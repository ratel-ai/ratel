# 13. Framework adapter SPI: `ratel(config).adaptTo(adapter)`

Date: 2026-07-15

## Status

Accepted

Builds on the framework-neutral capability tools (ADR-0005's `search_capabilities` /
`invoke_tool` / `get_skill_content` funnel) and the optional-peer detection pattern first shipped
for `@ratel-ai/telemetry-otlp`. Design source: the reviewed proposal *TS framework adapter
packages*; this ADR records the SPI that its first phase lands in `@ratel-ai/sdk`.

## Context

The SDK ships framework-neutral primitives (`ToolCatalog`, `SkillCatalog`, the capability-tool
builders) but no first-class way to work in a host framework's native tool and message shapes.
Every AI SDK or Mastra host re-hand-wrote the same glue: convert framework tools into catalog
registrations, wrap the capability tools back into framework tools, and splice a synthetic
`search_capabilities` pair into the framework's message array for per-turn recall. The
`bratislava` prototype (live-verified against `ai@7.0.26`) proved the glue is ~150 LOC of three
codecs, but also that the value lives in a set of guards that must not be re-derived per host —
reserved capability-tool ids, top-K clamping, first-registration-wins, passthrough of
non-executable tools, recall ids that are not transcript positions — and that a hand-duplicated
result shape drifts from the canonical one.

One package can't carry the peer-dependency ranges for every framework at once (npm can't scope
peers per subpath; `ai@^7` and `@mastra/core` can't both be peers of one package), so framework
support has to be per-package. The core must therefore expose a stable seam those packages plug
into.

## Decision

**A `RatelAdapter` SPI plus a `ratel(config)` factory. The core is a standalone,
framework-free object — a collection handle per catalog, an explicit `modelTools()`, a pure
`recall()` — and `adaptTo(aiSdk())` layers a framework-shaped view over the same state. An
adapter is three pure codecs; the core owns all state and every framework-independent guard.**

- **Registration and exposure are separate acts.** `r.tools` is a handle over the core's one
  `ToolCatalog` (mongo `db.collection` style): registration is callable at any time, including
  after exposure — the capability tools close over the live catalog and search at invocation
  time, and a semantic/hybrid catalog embeds incrementally per-register. `modelTools()` returns
  the model-facing set: the three capability tools (plus, on an adapted view, that view's
  passthroughs). It builds fresh objects per call — hosts take it once per agent instance and
  reuse it. Rejected: the one-shot `tools(appTools)` that ingested, built embeddings, and exposed
  in a single call — it hid that late registration is safe and made incremental use impossible.

- **`register` is async, not sync-chainable.** `ToolCatalog.register` embeds on a
  `"semantic"`/`"hybrid"` core, so registration is inherently asynchronous. The handle's
  `register(...)` returns that promise (`Promise<void>`) rather than a chainable `this`: it validates
  the input synchronously (a missing `execute`, reserved id, or framework-shaped tool throws *at the
  call site*, before the promise), then the promise resolves when the batch is indexed and embedded
  and rejects if embedding fails — so `await r.tools.register(...)` awaits the pass and surfaces its
  error, matching this ADR's promise that embedding errors surface at registration. `recall` and a
  dense `searchAsync` rank whatever is embedded now, so a caller awaits registration before them (the
  same contract as the underlying `ToolCatalog`). Rejected: a synchronous chainable `register` that
  returns `this` and discards the embedding promise — it *looked* synchronous while hiding an async
  pass, turning a missing `execute` or an embedding failure into a process-crashing unhandled
  rejection and forcing a bolt-on `settled()`/quiesce surface to observe completion; async
  `register` deletes that accidental complexity (the mongo `db.collection` analogy is itself async).

- **`semantic`/`hybrid` is a first-class factory config.** `RatelConfig` forwards both `method`
  and `embedding` to the two catalogs (ADR-0012's configurable models), so a semantic/hybrid core
  is fully usable through `ratel()`, not default-model-only. Retrieval keeps the SDK's
  sync/async split: the handle's `search(...)` is synchronous and BM25-only (a dense method throws
  with a pointer to `searchAsync`, rather than leaking the native migration error), and
  `searchAsync(...)` ranks any method off the event loop.

- **The seam is three codecs + one extension hook.** `ingest(id, tool)` maps a framework tool to
  a `CatalogRegistration` (or `"passthrough"` for provider-executed tools that must stay eagerly
  exposed; passthroughs are framework-shaped, so they live per view); `expose(tool)` wraps a
  Ratel `ExecutableTool` into a framework tool; `recallMessages(ref, recall)` renders the
  synthetic `search_capabilities` pair in the framework's message shape. `extend(base)` adds
  framework idioms (the AI SDK's mutate-and-append `appendRecall`, Mastra's `recallProcessor`)
  that surface on the adapted object with full framework typing via a `TExt` generic.

- **Framework validation stays live and core-owned.** `CatalogRegistration` may carry the
  framework's native `validateInput` parser alongside its JSON Schema. The shared `ToolCatalog`
  retains that parser with the executor, so every adapted view sees one authoritative validator;
  a native replacement replaces or clears it with the rest of the tool. Capability exposure
  delegates host prevalidation to the selected tool's current parser, including defaults and
  root-level transforms, then calls `invokeValidatedRaw` with that exact parsed value. Separating
  validation from raw execution is what lets an asynchronous parser coexist with a synchronously
  returned `AsyncIterable` and preserves framework streaming semantics. Direct `invoke` /
  `invokeRaw` still validate themselves; `invokeValidatedRaw` is the explicit bridge path for
  input already accepted by `validateInput`.

- **Live execution context is opaque, call-local, and adapter-tagged.** `Executor` and
  `CatalogRegistration.execute` accept an optional second `unknown` argument, `ToolCatalog.invoke`
  an optional third, and `invoke_tool` forwards that value unchanged. A context-aware adapter's
  `expose` codec wraps the framework's complete live context under a private package-stable tag;
  its ingested executor unwraps only that tag. A missing or foreign tag takes the framework's
  context-free fallback, which matters because several framework views may share one catalog.
  The core never reads, stores, or traces the value: it may contain credentials, cyclic objects,
  streams, or abort signals. Optional arguments preserve source compatibility and the exact
  one-argument runtime call for existing executors. Rejected: shared mutable state or async-local
  bridging (ambient coupling and tenant-leak risk), an untagged raw framework context (cross-view
  confusion), and a core-owned context union (couples the SDK to every framework).

- **Explicit `adaptTo(adapter())`, not string keys or auto-require.** Types flow through generics
  (`AdaptedRatel<A>` infers the framework's tool/message types and the adapter's helpers), so app
  code needs zero casts. A string key would need a module-augmentation registry plus a dynamic
  `require` (async under ESM, opaque to bundlers).

- **The core owns all state and guards.** One `ratel(config)` is one `ToolCatalog` + one
  `SkillCatalog` + a private recall-id counter, shared by every `adaptTo` view (multiple adapters
  over one core → one catalog, embeddings built once; drift between "the object you modify" and
  "what the capability tools search" is structurally impossible because every handle wraps the
  same instance). Reserved capability-tool ids throw on registration on both paths; recall top-K
  is capped at 50 (0, negative, or non-integer values fall back to the default 5, never an
  unbounded set); server grouping treats a leading `__` as no prefix. Duplicate-id
  semantics are split by path on purpose: the adapted (codec) path is first-registration-wins
  across every view, including globally claimed passthrough ids whose framework values remain
  local to their originating view, so repeated calls are idempotent and one view can't clobber
  another; the native path keeps the catalog's own replace-in-place semantics — it is the
  authoritative hot-swap path. The raw catalog stays reachable (`r.tools.catalog`) as the
  unguarded driver-level escape hatch.

- **All three capability tools are always advertised.** `modelTools()` never gates
  `get_skill_content` on `skills.size()`: the exposed set must not depend on registration order,
  or a skill registered after exposure makes `search_capabilities` return skill hits pointing at
  a tool the model was never given (a hard `NoSuchToolError` in AI SDK hosts). The
  `search_capabilities` description is pinned skills-inclusive the same way (an additive
  `advertiseSkills` option on the piecemeal builder, whose size-gated default is unchanged), so
  the exposed payload is byte-identical whether skills register before or after `modelTools()`.
  Loading from an empty skill catalog returns a structured error, not a missing tool — one
  dormant tool slot buys an order-independent, prompt-cache-stable set. Rejected: conditional
  advertisement with a caller pin — more surface for the same guarantee.

- **Core `recall(query)` is a pure query; adapted `recall` mints ids.** The core returns the
  canonical `SearchCapabilitiesResult` (or `null` on no match) with no call id — framework-free
  hosts format their own injection. The adapted view's `recall` returns the framework message
  pair (or `[]`, spending nothing) with a `callId` from the core's private counter, shared across
  views: history editing (trim/compaction) would otherwise repeat transcript positions as
  tool-call ids. A caller-supplied id factory was considered for restored-transcript collisions
  and deferred (YAGNI until a restore-heavy host needs it).

- **One exported `runCapabilitiesSearch` is the single source of truth for the result shape.**
  The agent path (`searchCapabilitiesTool`, origin `agent`) and both recall paths (origin
  `direct`) call it, so they can never drift — the drift risk the prototype carried by
  hand-duplicating the shape. The SDK also re-exports `JSONSchema7` as its public JSON-Schema
  spelling, so adapters type their registrations without casting through private SDK internals.

- **Detection powers error messages only.** A framework-shaped tool — a zod-style schema or a
  dynamic `description` — hitting the native `r.tools.register(...)` throws an actionable error
  that names the exact adapter package to install, probing known frameworks with the existing
  `isPeerInstalled`. (A merely missing `id` is a malformed *native* tool, not a framework one, so
  it takes its own plain error path rather than the adapter hint.) Detection can't tell *installed*
  from *in use* (Mastra depends on `ai` internally), so it never drives behavior — only the hint.

The existing piecemeal API remains source-compatible. The factory is additive; the only extension
to the executor path is the optional opaque context argument described above.

## Consequences

- A framework adapter is ~three pure functions plus its idioms; correctness of the shared guards
  and result shape is the core's job and is tested once. This is what makes community adapters
  safe: a runner-agnostic conformance testkit (`@ratel-ai/sdk/testkit`) pins the contract, driven
  by framework-supplied hooks and shipped with a reference adapter as the worked example.
- The first adapter (`@ratel-ai/vercel-ai-sdk`) sets the host-version compatibility policy
  adapters follow: peer on every supported host major at once (`ai@^5.0.0 || ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0`;
  `ai@4` predates the v5 tool/message reshape and is out of scope), one shared code path
  absorbing per-major differences at runtime rather than per-major builds, and CI rows at each
  supported major's exact floor + latest verified release (build, typecheck, test, pack,
  packed-consumer typecheck per row). Narrowing the supported-majors peer range is a breaking
  change of the adapter — never a patch or minor; widening to a new host major is additive.
- Telemetry stamping of the adapter's `name` as a `ratel.adapter` attribute is deferred to the
  adapter packages: the attribute is a vocabulary addition across the Rust/TS/Python telemetry
  triple (ADR-0007) and lands with the first adapter that emits it, not with the core SPI. The
  `name` field is carried on the SPI now so adapters supply it from day one.
- Late-registered *passthroughs* are the one thing an already-exposed set can't pick up (they are
  plain framework tools, not catalog entries); surfacing them requires re-taking `modelTools()` — a
  visible, deliberate prompt-cache bust rather than an implicit mutation.
- Rejected: string-keyed adapters and auto-require sugar (breaks bundlers and static typing).
  Rejected: auto-detecting the framework from inside the core (structurally unreliable under
  pnpm strict `node_modules`; an adapter declaring the framework as a peer resolves it
  correctly). Rejected: a mutating `recall` on the base (the mutate-and-append idiom is
  framework-specific; the base stays pure). Rejected: throwing `tools()`/`recall()` stubs on the
  un-adapted core (the standalone core is genuinely usable; the install-the-adapter hint moved to
  the native registration shape guard). Rejected: duplicating the top-K clamp and result shape
  into the recall path (the shared `runCapabilitiesSearch` removes the drift the prototype
  had).
