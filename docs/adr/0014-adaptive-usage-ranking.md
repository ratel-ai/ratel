# 14. Adaptive usage ranking: an online usage arm over the existing fusion

Date: 2026-07-20

## Status

Accepted

Builds on [ADR-0004](0004-retrieval-and-tool-selection.md) (the stable `searchable_text`
projection), [ADR-0011](0011-selectable-retrieval-methods.md) (the three methods and RRF),
and [ADR-0007](0007-telemetry-two-streams.md) (the local trace stream, whose sink seam this
subscribes to). Ratifies the 2026-07-06 adaptive-ranking brief with the amendments below.

Amended 2026-08-13 by [ADR-0020](0020-runtime-events-lane.md): the sink is now a fan-out
subscription seam. The learner remains an internal consumer and cannot be replaced by attaching
another subscriber.

Amended 2026-08-17: a graph may be **seeded offline from a captured baseline** before ranking is
switched on — see [Seeding from a baseline capture](#seeding-from-a-baseline-capture). Online
learning remains how ranking learns while serving; the "no build step" claim below is narrowed
to the serving path, not the bootstrap.

Amended 2026-08-20: the cluster policy (similarity threshold and coverage fraction) is
**configurable per catalog and recorded on the graph**, reversing the "fixed tuning, not public
knobs" position taken earlier the same day — see
[The clustering policy is configurable, and recorded](#the-clustering-policy-is-configurable-and-recorded).

Amended 2026-08-20: the dense tier admits a query by **member coverage**, not by one cosine
against the centroid — see [Two similarity tiers](#two-similarity-tiers). Not porting the
lexical tier's per-member guard was a defect, and it collapsed 12 distinct queries into a
single cluster in production.

Amended 2026-08-27: a cluster **records what its searches surfaced** — see [Impressions are
recorded, not consumed](#impressions-are-recorded-not-consumed). Edges still come from
invocations only; the decision below is unchanged and nothing reads the new map.

## Context

Every ranker in the engine scores **text similarity only** — BM25 over the flattened
projection, dense cosine, or their fusion. None of them has memory. A query like
`"why is the build broken"` ranks a `docker_build` tool first on the token *build*, and it
will do so on the thousandth repetition, in a project where every such query has ended in
`gh_run_list`.

The engine already emits the evidence that would fix this. `TraceEvent::Search` carries the
query and its ranked hits; `TraceEvent::InvokeStart` carries the tool that was actually
called. Adjacent, in one session, they are a user-confirmed relevance judgment — the search
literature's impression/click pair — and today nothing consumes them.

The 2026-07-06 brief proposed a "co-usage boost" over an intent graph, extracted by an LLM,
synced down the catalog loader seam. Specifying it surfaced that the loader seam does not
exist in code, that the LLM buys nothing load-bearing, and that the brief's multiplicative
combination is arithmetically worse than the additive one the crate already implements.

## Decision

**A third RRF arm, ranked by what users actually invoked after semantically similar
queries, learned online.**

### The read model

Queries are clustered; each cluster carries weighted edges to the capabilities invoked
after its members. A cluster is a row: `members` (the match key), an optional `centroid`,
a `label`, `terms`, `support`, and `tools` / `skills` edge maps.

- **Edges come from invocations, never from retrievals.** Recording retrieved ids would
  memorize the ranker's own output — including its errors — and reinforce them on every
  update. Invocations are the only point at which information the ranker does not already
  hold enters the system.
- **Online.** Clusters are created and grow as queries arrive; a cluster may boost from
  its first confirmed pair. There is no build step **on the serving path** — nothing has to
  be rebuilt for a query's evidence to reach ranking. A graph may still be *seeded* once,
  offline, before serving begins (see [Seeding from a baseline
  capture](#seeding-from-a-baseline-capture)); that is a bootstrap, not a build the serving
  path waits on.
- **The learner clusters at whatever tier the registry runs.** A `TraceEvent::Search`
  carries the query text, not its embedding, so the sink alone could only cluster on
  words. But a semantic/hybrid registry has *already embedded the query* for its own
  ranking, so it stashes that vector on the graph (a `Mutex` slot, written under the read
  lock) and the learner grows a real centroid from it — free, since the embedding was
  computed anyway. A `Bm25` registry loads no model and its clusters carry no centroid,
  reaching repeats and near-repeats only. The slot is keyed by query text: sessions share
  a graph, so a clobbered slot degrades to lexical clustering rather than attaching one
  session's embedding to another's question.
- **Support-scaled, not support-gated.** The arm's weight is `W · min(1, support/3)`, so
  one observation nudges and three or more get full weight. A batch design could filter
  weak clusters before use; an online one cannot, so the ramp does that job without making
  the user wait.
- **An observation is a *search* that was acted on, not an invoke.** One search that leads
  to three tool calls adds three edges but counts once: the agent used three capabilities
  to answer one question. Counting invokes let a single query reach full weight
  immediately, defeating the ramp — which is the normal shape of `search_capabilities`,
  not an edge case. This holds across catalogs too: `search_capabilities` fans one query
  to the tool and skill catalogs, each with its own learner, so the credit that makes it
  *one* observation lives on the shared graph, not per-learner (`CreditSlot`). That credit
  is keyed by query text with a single slot, so it is exact for the fan-out but under-counts
  two *concurrent* sessions that ask the same text and resolve different catalogs into one
  cluster — a rare, conservative trade accepted over threading a per-turn correlation id
  through the trace events; see `CreditSlot`.
- **Clusters age out.** The arm weight is `W · min(1, support/3) · recency`, where recency is
  `1` for a grace period (90d) after a cluster's last use and then halves every half-life
  (90d), evaluated against the newest observed event — so a topic that falls out of use fades
  and, past a floor, is evicted, while support stays a pure count (confidence). Recency is on
  the *arm weight*, not the edges: edge decay was invisible because RRF fuses on rank. Members
  are capped per cluster. Together these bound relevance drift and the unbounded growth of
  memory and cluster count (which is the search cost). The constants are unswept defaults.
- **Edge weights are plain invocation counts.** No recency term: only their *order* within
  a cluster reaches the fusion, so a decay factor applied uniformly to a cluster changed
  nothing that ranking could observe (see Rejected).

### The scorer

`score(id) = Σ_arms w_arm · 1/(RRF_K + rank_arm(id))`, with `w_bm25 = w_dense = 1` and
`w_usage = W · min(1, support/3)`, `W < 1`. The arm is **absent**, not zero-weighted, on a
miss, so an unmatched query ranks bit-identically to a registry with no graph.

`W < 1` is deliberate: at equal rank a capability the current query lexically matched
outranks one only history supports. The arm still promotes a low-ranked capability past
BM25's rank-0 (it contributes from both arms), but it cannot conjure one the base ranker
did not retrieve at all.

### Which capability the arm promotes first

An edge weight is a count of confirmed invocations, but serving that order raw lets a capability
invoked across many different intents rank on volume rather than on answering *this* question —
the mechanism behind the reported failure, where the most-invoked write op rode into every
task-phrased search. Worse, where counts tie the order fell through to the id tie-break, so a
write op could lead a read query on the strength of sorting earlier alphabetically.

Each count is therefore scaled by `1 + ln(clusters / clusters naming that capability)`. The
smoothing is load-bearing: plain `ln(N/cf)` sends a capability present in *every* cluster to
exactly zero, pinning a genuine workhorse last in every arm. The floor of 1.0 stops ubiquity
earning a promotion without making it earn a punishment, and it is why there is nothing here to
configure — unlike the cluster policy, the smoothing is the whole of the tuning, and the
statistic is derived from the graph's own edges rather than chosen.

**Counted over the raw edge maps, before any registry filtering.** Which capabilities a consumer
still defines is a property of its catalog, not of the graph; counting only survivors would make
two agents sharing a graph rank the same cluster differently, and a tool that knows every id
disagree with both. The corollary is that a capability the registry has dropped still counts
toward how spread out the others are — the observations happened, and it is what keeps the
numbers portable. Scoped per kind, since tools and skills are separate namespaces and a
tools-only cluster is ordinary.

The weight never reaches the arm's own RRF weight, which stays `W · min(1, support/3)`. It
changes the order *within* the arm and nothing else.

### Two similarity tiers

Online clustering needs a query-to-cluster similarity at search time.

| Method | similarity | reach |
|---|---|---|
| `Semantic` / `Hybrid` | share of members a query clears `TAU_MEMBER` against, centroid as prefilter | groups phrasings that share no words |
| `Bm25` | best Jaccard overlap with any single member | repeats and near-repeats only |

On semantic/hybrid the marginal cost is zero — the dense arm already embedded the query for
its own ranking. On `Bm25` no model is loaded at any point, so ADR-0011's model-free
default is preserved. The Bm25 tier is genuinely weaker and is documented as such.

**Both tiers score per member, never against an aggregate.** A union only grows, so scoring
against it let a mature cluster recognize most of the vocabulary, absorb unrelated asks, and
grow further — 100 distinct topics measured as 18 clusters, once as 1. Per-member Jaccard
keeps a cluster exactly as discriminating on its 200th member as on its first.

The dense tier shipped without that guard, and it has the same failure in a different
costume. A mean of unit vectors keeps the component its members share and cancels the ones
that distinguish them, so a diversifying cluster drifts toward the generic direction of its
domain — close to everything in it. Absorbing made it more generic, which made it absorb
more. Normalizing the centroid then divided out the very spread that would have shown this,
so a diffuse cluster presented as a tight one. Measured on real embeddings of 12 distinct
queries, it produced two clusters holding 11 and 1.

A query is therefore admitted when it clears `TAU_MEMBER` against a **majority** of the
cluster's vector-bearing members (`COVERAGE_FRACTION`, floored at two members and capped at
the cluster). A count is what separates *close to this whole cluster* from *close to one
thing in it*; a fraction keeps that test comparable across clusters of different sizes. The
centroid stays as a prefilter at the same threshold, so admission is provably the old rule
**and** coverage — a strict subset, never looser.

Per-member vectors are held in memory only, capped at the newest `VECTOR_RETAIN` per cluster:
fifty 384-dim vectors is ~230 KB of JSON per cluster crossing the SDK boundary on every save,
on an artifact that already carries raw query text. A cluster with none — every graph off the
wire — is *no dense evidence*, not a rejection, and falls back to the centroid scaled by the
cluster's recorded `cohesion`, which rises as a cluster spreads.

Rejected: **serializing the member vectors** (the size and privacy cost above); an
**all-members denominator**, which makes a cluster holding 20 lexical members and 2 dense ones
arithmetically unjoinable forever, and — since the lexical fallback is restricted to
centroid-less clusters — silently unable to arm again; and a **split pass** over existing
clusters, which the stored evidence cannot support (edges are cluster-level counts with no
member attribution, so splitting either copies the full edge set into every child, amplifying
the bad boost, or discards it and destroys the learning). Recency eviction is not a remedy
either: an over-merged cluster absorbs nearly every turn, so its `last_ts` stays fresh and it
is never approached.

### The clustering policy is configurable, and recorded

The similarity a query must clear and the share of members it must clear it against — the
**cluster policy** — are set per catalog and default to today's values.

This reverses the position first recorded here, which was that they are fixed tuning like
`BM25_K1` and `RRF_K`. Two arguments overturned it. The threshold is **model-dependent**: an
endpoint catalog can carry any embedding model, and a cosine of 0.70 does not mean the same
thing on two of them. It is **corpus-dependent** too — a narrow single-domain catalog and a
broad one want different granularity, and the integrator knows their corpus better than a
constant chosen once against one model. Measured on the checked-in incident fixture, bge-small
puts same-intent query pairs at a median cosine of 0.688 and distinct-intent pairs at 0.639, so
even for the built-in model 0.70 sits inside the overlap rather than between the modes.

The decisive objection was not that these are geometry rather than policy — it was that **the
wire format did not record the constants a graph was clustered under**, so two producers at
different values would disagree about what a cluster means while both claiming `v: 1`. That
objection is answered rather than waived: the graph now carries its policy, exactly as it
already carries the `model` its centroids were built with, and a consumer can tell the two
apart. `VECTOR_RETAIN` stays internal — it bounds memory, it does not draw boundaries.

`ObservationPolicy` remains a different thing, and the distinction is where each lives.
It configures which *events* become evidence, so it belongs to the learner. The cluster policy
is read while matching, from both the learning and the serving path, so it belongs to the graph
— which is also what makes recording it natural.

**A policy change is a notice, not a pause.** A model mismatch pauses the arm because cosine
across two vector spaces is meaningless. A policy mismatch is not that: the vectors are fine and
the clusters are still coherent, merely coarser or finer than the current setting would draw
them. The mechanical reason matters more than the principle. Both SDKs auto-recover on a status
beginning `paused`, and the remedy they reach for is `rebuild_intent_graph` — which cannot
revisit cluster boundaries, for the reason given above. Routing a policy change through that
string would fire an embedding pass incapable of fixing what it fired for, so the new status
begins `active` and the notice is raised deliberately instead.

Changing the policy therefore **does not re-cluster**. Raising the threshold on a graph that
already over-merged leaves those clusters exactly as they are; only later admissions are
stricter. Re-drawing boundaries means replaying the trace log through `build_intent_graph`, or
relearning from scratch.

The cost is recall, and it is the right trade. Two queries sharing one word out of two are
structurally identical whether they are the same question phrased differently or two
unrelated asks; no word-overlap rule can accept one and reject the other. This tier rejects
both, because **a false merge degrades ranking while a false split only misses a boost**.
Bridging distant wording is what the dense tier is for.

Because `members` is the match key and `centroid` is optional, a graph grown under one tier
is consumable by the other. **The tier is chosen from what the graph carries, not from the
caller's search method**: a semantic catalog handed a centroid-less graph matches it
lexically rather than seeing nothing. Without that fallback the in-process learner's own
output would be invisible to the very methods it is meant to improve.

### Impressions are recorded, not consumed

`Intent::surfaced` counts, per cluster, how many of its searches put each **tool** in front of
the caller — counting only searches the caller then acted on, so an abandoned search still
teaches nothing. Tools only: skill ids are a different id space.

**It is the denominator the edge map never had.** `tools` records that a capability was chosen;
nothing recorded how often it was offered and passed over. Those look identical: a tool shown
twelve times and invoked once is indistinguishable from one shown once and invoked once. On the
harness fixture `create_task` is the most-surfaced tool in the catalog, shown for 30 of 47
queries and invoked 6 times, while `create_task_for_branch` is shown 9 times and invoked never —
and none of that is expressible in `tools`. It is also the evidence the misranking
investigation's row #6 asks for, and the loop it names (search → nothing → create, which teaches
`create_task` and unteaches nothing) is invisible without it.

**Nothing consumes it.** The arm's order is still `tools` scaled by inverse cluster frequency.
An id in `surfaced` with no entry in `tools` has no edge, contributes nothing, and cannot be
promoted — pinned by a test, beside the one pinning that retrieval never becomes an edge.

**This does not reverse "edges come from invocations, never from retrievals."** That decision
rejects promoting a retrieved id to evidence, and it still holds: recording how often an
*existing* edge was offered is a denominator for evidence already gathered, not new evidence.
The distinction is load-bearing, because the objection to the rejected design — that it
memorizes the ranker's own output and reinforces it — inverts here: an impression can only ever
count *against* a tool the ranker surfaced.

Ranking on it is a separate decision, deliberately not taken, and two things must be answered
first. **Position bias**: a tool ranked first is invoked more for being first, so the ratio
partly measures where we ranked it, and feeding that back is circular; the standard mitigation
counts only impressions above the invoked item's rank, which is untried here. And **it may not
address the failure it was proposed for**: where a tool is genuinely dominant its ratio stays
high, so this guards against riding on volume, not against a real majority.

Recorded with the same wire treatment as `seeded_support` — optional, absent means none, no
version bump — and marked PROVENANCE ONLY in `protocol/v1`, so a consumer that does not
understand it ignores it and one that does may not rank on it.

### Embedding-model changes

Centroids are model-specific — cosine only means anything against a query embedded by the
*same* model. The graph therefore records its model as an optional `model` fingerprint
(absent for a lexical graph), and a semantic/hybrid search compares it against the active
model. On a mismatch — a different output dimension, or the same width with a different
identity (a fine-tune; a length check cannot catch this) — the usage arm **pauses** (base
ranking is untouched) rather than cosine across incompatible spaces, and the learner
**freezes** centroid growth so it never blends two spaces. This deliberately differs from the
corpus cache, which hard-errors: the corpus cannot produce dense results without matching
embeddings, but the usage arm has a valid fall-through (no boost), so breaking search over a
stale *enhancement* would be worse than the problem.

The mismatch is surfaced three ways: a `TraceEvent::UsageModelMismatch` (structured, always),
a one-time SDK stderr warning (default on, `warnOnModelMismatch: false` to suppress), and an
`experimentalAdaptiveRankingStatus` the app can gate on. `experimentalRebuildIntentGraph()` re-embeds the graph's
members under the current model and restamps — members, support, and edges are
model-independent, so all learning survives; only the centroids move.

Recovery is **explicit by default**: the arm stays paused until the caller invokes
`experimentalRebuildIntentGraph()`, because a rebuild is an embedding pass (cost, can fail, mutates the
graph and bumps `rev`) and the paused fall-through is safe in the meantime. For zero-touch
recovery, `experimentalEnableAdaptiveRanking(graph, { rebuildOnModelChange: true })` (`rebuild_on_model_change=True`
in Python) opts in: the next dense search re-embeds the graph before searching, then proceeds.
It lives on the catalog, not `IntentGraph` — the graph is a pure wire type with no embedder;
only the catalog owns the model. Recovery is lazy (dense search is async-only, `enable` is
sync), so `experimentalAdaptiveRankingStatus` reads `paused` until that first dense search; a failed
rebuild raises the same `EmbedderError` the dense query itself would. Off by default keeps the
expensive, fallible operation from being implicit.

### Persistence, change-tracking, and forward compatibility

The graph is in-process; the caller owns storage (`toJson`/`fromJson`). That is deliberate —
Ratel runs with no infra and must not pick a backend (file, SQLite, the app's own DB, S3).
But delegating storage without the primitives to do it safely is a trap, so the wire form
carries a **monotonic `rev` counter**, bumped once per mutation (a confirmed observation, a
rebuild) and never read during ranking. It answers two questions the caller otherwise cannot:

- **Save-when-changed.** Learning happens on every confirmed invoke, in memory; a crash loses
  whatever was not persisted. Rather than serialize on every invoke (wasteful) or guess
  (lossy), the caller snapshots `rev` after each save and writes again only when it differs.
- **Stale-base detection.** Two writers that both load, learn, and save would silently clobber
  each other. Before overwriting a stored graph, the caller compares its `rev` to the one it
  loaded; a higher value means another writer moved ahead. **Single-writer is the supported
  model** — `rev` makes a collision *detectable*, not merged. Automatic merge is rejected: it
  would mean owning the storage layer, the very thing delegation avoids.

Forward compatibility is a contract, not a hope: within schema `v: 1` fields are **additive**,
a consumer **ignores unknown fields** (no `deny_unknown_fields`; `additionalProperties: true`
in the schema), and an unrecognized `v` is a **typed error** (`UnsupportedVersion`), never a
panic or a silent degrade. An older graph missing a newer field (`model`, `last_ts`, `rev`)
loads with a safe default. Conformance vectors pin all three guarantees so a future change
cannot quietly regress them.

### Opt-in, per registry

A usage arm turns `SearchHit.score` from a BM25 score into an RRF score. ADR-0011 promises
`search` / `search_with_origin` keep BM25 behavior byte-for-byte, so the graph attaches per
registry and those entry points are untouched — the same containment ADR-0011 used for
fallibility.

Because that makes `score` switch scale *between calls* on one catalog (raw when a query
matches no cluster, RRF when it matches one), each hit carries `rank` (0-based position,
scale-invariant) and `fused` (whether `score` is an RRF score). Callers order/threshold on
`rank` and branch on `fused`; `score` is a within-list hint only. Deliberately no normalized
confidence — BM25, cosine, and RRF have no honest common scale, so any single number would
be fabricated.

The SDK entry points ship behind an `experimental` prefix —
`experimentalEnableAdaptiveRanking` / `experimental_enable_adaptive_ranking` and its
`rebuild` / `disable` / `status` siblings — per the additive-evolution convention
([AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)): a new, unproven capability is marked until it earns promotion,
then the prefix is dropped. The marker sits on the *behavior* entry points only. `IntentGraph`
and its `to_json` / `from_json` / `rev` keep stable names — it is a `protocol/v1` wire type
whose versioning already governs its evolution, and the experimental methods are the sole way
to activate it, so they gate all use on their own.

### Where learning happens

The learner consumes `Search` and `InvokeStart` through the core fan-out specified by
[ADR-0020](0020-runtime-events-lane.md). It is composed as an internal subscriber/decorator,
not installed into a replace-only sink slot: adding a JSONL, SDK, or Cloud subscriber MUST NOT
silently disable learning. The public queue and callback machinery stays outside the learner,
so stalled subscribers cannot block it. Adaptive ranking remains experimental; its decoration
may be simplified if that is required to keep fan-out robust.

### Seeding from a baseline capture

Online learning has two cold-start problems, both of which this ADR states elsewhere and
neither of which the ramp addresses. A fresh deployment has no evidence, so it gets no boost
until pairs accumulate. And once Ratel *is* ranking, what the agent invokes is partly Ratel's
own doing — the feedback loop under Consequences. Both are the same shape: the cleanest
evidence available is what an agent invoked while Ratel was **not** in the retrieval path, and
until now there was no way to record it.

**A host may capture turns while Ratel serves nothing, build a graph from that log offline,
inspect it, and only then enable ranking.**

- **A fourth origin, `Origin::Baseline`.** Ratel's own search path never produces it. The host
  names the turn's query text — a run where nobody searches has no query, and a graph is keyed
  on query text — and Ratel is a recorder for the duration.
- **The turn is the unit, and it is buffered.** Nothing reaches the log until `record()`, so
  declining to call it is how a host drops a turn it would not want learned from. One turn
  stays **one** observation, holding the line the `CreditSlot` bullet draws: a search with
  three invocations recorded as three turns would count the query three times and defeat the
  ramp.
- **Building embeds every distinct query up front**, so clusters form at the **dense** tier —
  the tier the live path would have grown them at. A model-free replay clusters lexically, and
  `rebuild_intent_graph` cannot repair that later: it replaces centroids without revisiting
  cluster boundaries, and it cannot revisit them — edges carry no member attribution, so there
  is nothing to split them on. Getting the tier right is therefore a property of the build,
  not something a caller can fix afterwards.

  A rebuild *is* the mitigation for a graph grown before coverage existed, or loaded from the
  wire where per-member vectors cannot travel: it re-embeds every member — **query-side**,
  since members are past queries and the document path would put them in a manifold live
  queries never reach — and keeps those vectors, so the dense tier can tell the cluster's
  members apart again. Boundaries and edges are untouched, and a cluster that over-merged then
  covers any specific query poorly, so it stops boosting broadly. Re-clustering outright means
  replaying the trace log through `build_intent_graph`, or dropping the graph and relearning.
- **The pairing rule exists once.** The live learner and the offline replay share one
  `classify` step. They differ only in where pending state lives — a per-session learner holds
  a slot, a replay holds a map keyed by `session_id` — because a log interleaves sessions by
  construction and a single slot would cross-pair them. Replay walks the log in **its own
  order, never re-sorted**: file order is arrival order, and sorting by `ts` would produce a
  graph the live path could not have grown, since cluster membership depends on which clusters
  existed when each query arrived. `ts` stamps observations; it does not order them.
- **Equivalence is asserted by test, not by this document** — a graph built from a log *is*
  the graph live learning would have grown from the same events. It diverges in exactly one
  place, and that divergence is also pinned: interleaved sessions asking identical text, where
  the live path's single global credit slot under-counts (the trade the `CreditSlot` bullet
  accepts) and replay, knowing the session, does not.
- **Policy is a closed set, and applies to both paths.** `origins` (`any` | `agent` |
  `baseline`) selects which searches may open an observation window; `provenance` (`live` |
  `seeded`) selects whether what is learned is marked as seeded. What counts as evidence must
  not depend on which path produced the graph, so both take the same policy. Building defaults
  to `baseline`/`seeded` — that is what an offline build *is* — while enabling live learning
  keeps `any`/`live`, so existing behavior is unchanged. `direct` is a valid search origin but
  deliberately **not** a filter: learning only from searches your own plumbing made is
  learning from your plumbing.
- **A rejected search is ignored, not cleared.** One of Ratel's own internal searches landing
  between a captured query and its invocations must not discard the turn's evidence.
- **Provenance is recorded, and is inert.** `seeded_support` on a cluster counts how many of
  its `support` observations came from a seeding pass. It is `protocol/v1`-additive, omitted
  when zero, and **ranking must not read it**: two graphs differing only here rank identically
  and compare equal. Its use is operational — after the flip, `support` grows while
  `seeded_support` stays put, so the gap says how much still rests on the baseline.
- **Building never enables ranking.** The returned graph is detached; attaching stays an
  explicit call. Inspecting before the flip is the whole point of seeding first, so the API
  must not make enabling the default outcome of building.
- **The destination may belong to the host.** A single process holding the turn open is the
  wrong model for a process-per-request server across N instances, which is the first real
  deployment this targets: the search and the invocation that follows are different requests,
  on possibly different machines. Two seams follow, both specified in
  [ADR-0007](0007-telemetry-two-streams.md) — a closure sink (`FnSink`, the SDKs' `"callback"`)
  so the host writes envelopes to storage it already runs, and a **whole-turn** recording call
  for a turn the host reassembled itself. The whole-turn call is not mere ergonomics: the
  chained builder permits an `await` between invocations, so concurrent turns can interleave
  their events in one sink and break the search-then-invoke adjacency the pairing depends on.

### What is open source

The **format** is specified in [`protocol/v1`](../../protocol/v1/README.md) beside
`CatalogSkillWire`, and the local learner ships in `ratel-ai-core` under Apache-2.0. Ratel
Cloud is a second producer of the same format from hosted traces — the "usage-ranking read
model" ADR-0003 named as the first candidate to open. Labels are medoid + c-TF-IDF, both
counted from the member strings; no model, no key, no vendor in the OSS path. Cloud's
LLM-extracted intents populate the same `members` field.

## Consequences

- Retrieval gains a signal no amount of description-writing can supply: what users chose
  when the ranker was wrong. The tool author's vocabulary stops being the only lever
  (ADR-0004).
- **Ranking becomes order-dependent.** The same events in a different order produce a
  different graph. This is a real reversal of the determinism posture `Bm25Index::search` and
  `sort_and_truncate` hold elsewhere, accepted as the cost of learning without a build
  step; replaying the JSONL trace log is the escape hatch when a reproducible artifact is
  needed (CI, benchmarks, bug reports).
- **The graph accumulates from a stream ADR-0007 permits to drop events.** A dropped
  invoke is lost permanently rather than recovered on the next rebuild. Replay is the
  repair path.
- Persistence is the caller's: `toJson`/`fromJson` plus a monotonic `rev` for save-when-changed
  and stale-base detection (single-writer supported; no built-in merge). Replaying
  `~/.ratel/telemetry` at construction is an alternative cross-session path, and needs no new
  storage because `JsonlSink` already writes that log.
- `members` holds raw query text. Whatever persists it must match the `0600` treatment
  `JsonlSink` already applies.
- A feedback loop is inherent — boosting used capabilities makes them more used. `W < 1`
  and the support ramp bound it; they do not remove it. Seeding from a baseline gives the
  loop a starting point Ratel had no hand in, which bounds where it *begins*; it does not
  bound where it goes.
- **Every invocation is evidence, and seeding assumes it is good evidence.** Nothing in a
  trace says whether a turn went well — a trace records which capability was called, never
  whether calling it was right — so nothing is filtered, and the quality gate is the host's:
  seed from an agent you already trust. The exposure is bounded by the same property that
  makes edge decay pointless (see Rejected): edge weights set only *order* within a cluster,
  so one wrong invocation of a capability the base ranker already favours is close to free —
  and, symmetrically, more good data does not dislodge it.
- **Readiness is measured by coverage, not by cluster count.** Clusters, observations, and
  support all rise whether or not the graph generalises; only held-out queries that match a
  cluster say it does. The threshold behind the support ramp is not exposed, so a caller
  currently hardcodes it — a first-class readiness surface is still owed.
- **Rebuilding is O(whole log).** Fine as a nightly or one-time seed, wasteful per turn. The
  offline path is a bootstrap and a repair path, not a serving-time operation.
- **Clusters fade and evict, but `support` only rises.** A topic that falls out of use
  loses arm weight through the recency multiplier and, past the eviction floor, is dropped
  (see Decision). `support` itself is a pure count that never decreases, so it records
  confidence, not currency — staleness is handled on the arm weight and cluster lifetime,
  never on edge magnitudes.

## Rejected

- **Recency decay on edge weights** (`Σ 2^(−Δt/half_life)`, built and then removed). It
  discounted old invocations correctly, but the fusion consumes *rank position*: decaying
  every edge in a cluster by the same factor left their order unchanged, so ranking could
  not observe it. It only reordered when two capabilities in one cluster differed sharply
  in recency — a narrow case bought with a wire field, a tuning constant, and a time
  parameter threaded through the learning path. The staleness it appeared to address (a
  whole cluster going cold) it never addressed, since `support` and cluster lifetime are
  untouched by it.

- **Multiplicative fusion with intent similarity as a factor** (the brief's
  `BM25/dense × intent-similarity × co-usage`): a `W·(cos−τ)/(1−τ)` ramp scores 0.53 at
  cos 0.78 and ranks the correct capability *below* where no boost at all would leave it.
  Real match similarities occupy 0.70–0.90, so a ramp normalized to 1.0 spends its range
  where nothing lives. Similarity is a gate; the arms combine additively.
- **Recording retrieved capabilities as edges**: self-reinforcing, adds no information. Still
  rejected — and distinct from `Intent::surfaced`, which counts retrievals as a *denominator*
  for edges invocations already wrote, promotes nothing, and is read by nothing.
- **An LLM for intent extraction or labeling in the OSS path**: labels are cosmetic —
  identical retrieval results if every label were `intent_17`. The crate is encoder-only
  (`candle_transformers::models::bert`); adding a generation path, and a download or an
  API key, to produce display strings is not a trade worth making. Medoid + c-TF-IDF are
  counted from the members and cannot hallucinate. Cloud may label however it likes; the
  format carries a plain string.
- **An optional OpenAI-compatible labeling endpoint**: the precedent in
  `embedding_config.rs` does not transfer, because embedding quality is load-bearing and
  label text is not. An OSS artifact that reaches for a service to produce cosmetic strings
  reads as a hole where a product should be.
- **Tool↔tool co-usage** (the brief's "co-usage"): a different signal from the intent→tool
  edges the impression/click pairing yields. Possible fourth arm later; not carried by
  this decision.
- **Batch rebuild _as the serving model_**: reproducible and able to sweep thresholds
  corpus-wide, but a query's evidence would not affect ranking until the next build.
  Immediacy was ratified over determinism. This rejection is about what serving *waits on*
  and still stands. The offline build added by the 2026-08-17 amendment is the batch path
  this entry pointed at ("replay preserves the batch path where it is needed"), scoped to a
  bootstrap and a repair path: it runs before ranking is enabled, or out of band, and no
  search ever blocks on it.
- **Shipping the graph down the catalog loader seam** (the brief's "no new machinery"): no
  `RATEL_URL` or `CatalogSource` exists in `src/` — the seam is specified, not built.
  Revisit when PSKS-5 lands.
