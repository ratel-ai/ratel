# 4. Retrieval: tool indexing and replace-vs-suggest selection

Date: 2026-07-05

## Status

Accepted

Compacted 2026-07 from pre-compaction ADR-0003 (tool selection, 2026-04-30) and ADR-0004
(tool indexing, 2026-04-30).

## Context

The engine ranks an agent's registered tools per query and returns the top-K. Two questions
stack: what text a tool contributes to the index (indexing raw schema JSON would drown the
meaningful tokens in structural noise), and how the ranked result reaches the model (replace
the tool list, or suggest alongside it).

## Decision

### Indexing

The durable decision is **what text represents a tool**, independent of the scorer that ranks
it:

- A private `searchable_text(&Tool) -> String` flattener emits **only semantic tokens**, in
  order: tool name, description, then per property in schema-defined order its key,
  description, and enum string values, recursing into nested objects and array `items`; the
  same for the output schema. Structural tokens (`type`, `required`, `$ref`, braces, quotes)
  are skipped. Schema-defined order is preserved via `serde_json`'s `preserve_order`, so the
  projection is deterministic. `Tool` carries `input_schema` and `output_schema` as
  `serde_json::Value`; both are walked.
- This flattened projection is the **contract**: telemetry, suggestions, and every retrieval
  layer build on it. Changing the flattening algorithm is a breaking change and warrants
  supersession.

The scorer over that projection is **lexical today and expected to evolve**:

- Current retrieval uses the [`bm25`](https://crates.io/crates/bm25) crate with its default
  English tokenizer, tuned `k1 = 0.9`, `b = 0.4` (below the crate defaults, because tool
  descriptions are short: term frequency saturates faster and length normalization matters
  less).
- BM25 is **not a fixed decision.** Semantic / embedding retrieval is planned and is expected
  to **merge with** the lexical signal (hybrid ranking), not replace the projection. The
  `searchable_text` contract above is what stays stable across that change; the ranker and its
  parameters are current tuning, not a frozen surface.

### Selection

- **`replace` is the default**: Ratel intercepts the tool list before the model call and
  replaces it with the ranked top-K. The token reduction is direct and attributable.
- **`suggest` is opt-in**: a ranked subset emitted alongside the existing tool list, for
  frameworks that own the list and offer no replace seam.
- Both modes are a configurable enum on the public API; each framework integration wires the
  chosen mode to the framework's actual tool-injection point.

## Consequences

- The tool author's vocabulary (description, parameter names, enum values) flows directly
  into recall: documentation quality is the retrieval lever, and the integrator's knob.
- The current `k1`/`b` are fixed tuning, reproducible for today's benchmarks; they are not a
  public knob. Revisiting them, or adding a semantic ranker alongside, does not disturb the
  `searchable_text` contract.
- Rejected: rolling our own lexical scorer (maintenance, no gain at this scope); indexing raw
  JSON (flattens term distribution, hurts IDF); a typed schema struct instead of `Value`
  (locks the public `Tool` shape at every framework boundary); `suggest` as default (ranking
  competes with framework-appended tools, savings become unattributable).
