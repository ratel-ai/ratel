//! The online learner: turns the trace stream into an [`IntentGraph`]
//! (ADR-0014).
//!
//! # Why this is a sink
//!
//! The two halves of a relevance judgment arrive through *different* API calls —
//! a search, then an invoke — and the registries have no session concept to join
//! them with. Trace sinks do: each is constructed per session. ADR-0007 already
//! frames the sink as the subscription seam ("rerankers, suggestion analysis,
//! and inspection subscribe to different cuts of the same producer"), so the
//! learner needs no new plumbing — it decorates whatever sink is already
//! installed and forwards every event untouched.
//!
//! **Pairing is keyed by `turn_id`.** [`crate::trace::TraceEventContext::turn_id`]
//! is a caller-supplied id correlating one logical turn's search with the
//! invoke(s) that confirm it — distinct from the trace-*stream* `session_id`
//! fixed at sink construction. A learner shared by multiple concurrent
//! sessions stays correct as long as each supplies its own `turn_id`. A
//! caller that never supplies one shares the one `None` slot, reproducing the
//! original single-slot behavior — including its cross-session collisions —
//! as the accepted cost of opting out. Because that slot is keyed by `None`
//! rather than a sentinel *string*, a caller who explicitly supplies an empty
//! `turn_id` does not collide with it — it gets its own slot, like any other
//! value.
//!
//! # What counts as evidence
//!
//! ```text
//! Search{query}      → remembered as this session's pending query
//! InvokeStart{tool}  → paired with it → one confirmed observation
//! ```
//!
//! Only **invocations** become edges. What retrieval *returned* is the ranker's
//! own guess; recording it would teach the graph what it already believes and
//! reinforce its mistakes. A search nobody acts on teaches nothing and is
//! dropped.
//!
//! A pending query survives until the next search replaces it, so an agent that
//! searches once and invokes three tools records three observations — that is
//! genuinely what happened.
//!
//! # How far a cluster reaches
//!
//! A [`TraceEvent::Search`] carries the query *text*, not its embedding, so the
//! sink alone could only cluster on words. A semantic/hybrid registry closes
//! that gap: it has already embedded the query for its own ranking and stashes
//! that vector on the graph, so the learner grows a real centroid and clusters
//! phrasings that share **no vocabulary** — "delete a path" with "remove
//! something". A `Bm25` registry loads no model (ADR-0011), so its clusters
//! carry no centroid and reach repeats and near-repeats only.
//! [`IntentGraph::arm`] picks the tier from what the graph carries, so either
//! kind works on every [`crate::SearchMethod`].
