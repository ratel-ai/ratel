//! The usage-ranking read model: clusters of past queries, each carrying
//! weighted edges to the capabilities users actually invoked after them
//! (ADR-0013).
//!
//! A query is matched to at most one cluster, and that cluster's capabilities
//! become an extra ranked arm for [`crate::fusion::rrf_fuse_weighted`] beside
//! BM25 and dense retrieval. Two things follow from that and are easy to lose:
//!
//! - **Only the arm's *order* is used.** Edge weights choose the order and are
//!   then discarded; RRF fuses on rank position, so a weight never has to be
//!   reconciled with a BM25 or cosine score.
//! - **A miss produces no arm at all**, not a zero-weighted one. A query that
//!   matches nothing ranks bit-identically to a registry with no graph.
//!
//! Matching has two tiers, because the graph must work on a `Bm25` catalog that
//! has no embedder ([`crate::SearchMethod`], ADR-0011):
//!
//! - [`IntentGraph::arm_dense`] — cosine against a cluster's stored centroid.
//!   Groups phrasings that share no words. Used by semantic/hybrid, where the
//!   query embedding was already computed for the dense arm, so it costs nothing.
//! - [`IntentGraph::arm_lexical`] — token overlap against a cluster's member
//!   bag. No model is ever loaded. Reaches repeats and near-repeats only; it
//!   cannot connect "why is the build broken" to "did CI pass".
//!
//! The wire shape is `protocol/v1/schema/intent-graph.schema.json`; this is its
//! consumer. An edge weight is a plain count of confirmed invocations: it orders
//! the arm and nothing more, since RRF then fuses on rank position.
