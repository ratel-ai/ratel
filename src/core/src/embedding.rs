//! Dense embedders behind the semantic/hybrid engines. The model is configurable
//! per catalog (see [`crate::embedding_config`] and ADR-0012); this module owns
//! the two backends and the process-wide, identity-keyed embedder cache.
//!
//! - [`CandleEmbedder`] runs a **BERT-family** model in-process via Candle — the
//!   built-in default (`bge-small-en-v1.5`), any HuggingFace repo, or an on-disk
//!   directory. Pure-Rust inference (no C++/ONNX native dep) keeps the SDK
//!   wheels/addons clean cross-platform. Pooling (CLS or mean) is auto-detected
//!   from the model's `1_Pooling/config.json` (overridable, warn-then-assume-mean
//!   when absent), then we L2-normalize, so cosine similarity is a dot product
//!   (see [`crate::dense_search`]). It supports asymmetric models on both sides —
//!   an optional query prefix and doc prefix. Weights load from
//!   `model.safetensors` or a `pytorch_model.bin` fallback.
//! - [`EndpointEmbedder`] calls an OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings` HTTP endpoint
//!   (OpenAI, Ollama, TEI, vLLM…) — any model, including non-BERT ones. Returned
//!   vectors are **re-normalized** on ingestion (an arbitrary endpoint may not
//!   normalize), so `dense_search`'s unit-vector assumption always holds.
//!
//! In-process weights are **not** bundled and live in the shared HuggingFace
//! cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`, `HF_HOME`-overridable). Ratel **auto-downloads
//! only the built-in default**; an explicit HuggingFace model is **cache-only**
//! (it must already be present, or opt in with `download=true`) — a missing one
//! errors as [`EmbedderError::NotCached`], symmetric with Ollama's "not pulled",
//! so an explicit embedding build never silently pulls a multi-GB model. Once cached, load is
//! offline and deterministic when the revision is pinned. Two catalogs on the
//! same model share one resident embedder (keyed by model fingerprint); a cold
//! download emits a [`TraceEvent::EmbedderDownload`].
//!
//! **Footprint & failure modes.** A resident BERT model is ~130 MB+ of f32
//! weights plus runtime buffers, and inference is CPU-only, so a constrained
//! machine may load or embed slowly — surfaced as a [`TraceEvent::EmbedderLoad`]
//! with status `slow` — or, if it runs out of memory, be killed by the OS (an
//! uncatchable SIGKILL, nothing we can flag). Load and inference are otherwise
//! **fallible**: a failure returns a typed [`EmbedderError`] (network, unwritable
//! cache, corrupt weights, inference, dimension mismatch, config) rather than
//! aborting the process, and a failed load is **not cached**, so a later call
//! retries once the cause clears.
