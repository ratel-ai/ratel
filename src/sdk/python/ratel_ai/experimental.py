"""Experimental facts/grounding API — opt in explicitly.

This module re-exports the entire facts and grounding surface: `FactCatalog` /
`Fact` (the push-path grounding analogue — constant content injected into the
context), the pure `plan_injection` freshness gate, and their supporting types.

It is an **experimental** API. It may change or be removed without a major
version bump, so it lives outside the stable root package instead of `ratel_ai`.
Import from here so the dependency is explicit:

    from ratel_ai.experimental import FactCatalog, Fact, plan_injection

Constructing a `FactCatalog` emits a one-time `ExperimentalWarning`; set
`RATEL_EXPERIMENTAL_SILENCE=1` to silence it.
