    The returned tool resolves `toolId`, forwards the nested `args` object to
    `ToolCatalog.invoke`, and never raises into the host: an unknown id,
    malformed `args`, or a tool exception all come back as a structured
    `{"error": ..., "isError": True}` payload the model can recover from. A
    flattened call (arguments at the top level instead of nested under `args`)
    is tolerated. When the tool raises an `UnauthorizedError`, the payload is
    `{"error": "needs_auth", ...}` with a re-auth hint and, for namespaced
    `<server>__<tool>` ids, the upstream server name.

    Args:
        catalog: the catalog to resolve and run tool ids against.
        on_unauthorized: called with the upstream server name when a tool
            raises `UnauthorizedError`; may be sync or async. Skipped when the
