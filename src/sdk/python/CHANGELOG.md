# Changelog

All notable changes to `ratel-ai` (the Python SDK) are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this package adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0-rc.4] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **`SearchHit.normalized` and `SkillHit.normalized` are renamed to `relevance`.** **Breaking** against the `0.13.0-rc.*` prereleases only; the field has never shipped in a stable release, so `0.12.0` users are unaffected. The old name described how the number was produced rather than what it tells you, and it invited reading the value as a probability. It is not one — nothing was fitted to whether a hit was the one you went on to use. `relevance` says what it is: how well the hit matches the query, on `[0, 1]`. If you are on an rc, rename the field at your call sites; nothing else changes.

## [0.13.0-rc.3] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- A tool call that reports failure in its result (`isError`) now closes the `execute_tool` span as `ERROR` and emits `invoke_error`; it previously recorded as a success. Covers both the dict shape and the `mcp` client's `CallToolResult`, whose field is `isError` on mcp 1.x and `is_error` on 2.x.
- **Hybrid results could come back in the wrong order when several hits scored at the top.** Fused scores were capped at `1.0` before being sorted, so two strong hits collapsed to the same value and fell back to alphabetical order by id. This bit hardest with adaptive ranking on: a tool you use constantly could be listed below one you never use, purely because its id sorted later. Ordering now uses the uncapped score. Nothing you can read changes — `score` and `normalized` are still `[0, 1]` — only the order, and only where it was wrong. `"bm25"` and `"semantic"` were never affected.

### Added

- **`experimental_dense_weight` on `ToolCatalog` and `SkillCatalog`: the hybrid dense/lexical split.** How much of a hybrid score the semantic arm carries; BM25 takes the remainder. Default `0.7` — unchanged ranking if you do not set it — read by `"hybrid"` only. The default was measured on corpora of natural-language descriptions; a catalog keyed on exact identifiers, error codes, or internal jargon gives the lexical arm purchase those corpora do not have and will want a lower value. `0` is pure lexical, `1` pure dense. Anything outside `[0, 1]` raises `ValueError` at construction rather than being clamped, so a mistyped `70` is reported instead of silently searching at `1`. It does not scale the adaptive-ranking arm, whose share is a separate guard.

## [0.13.0-rc.2] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **Hybrid search fuses on normalised scores rather than rank positions.** **Breaking:** hybrid results may come back in a different order. The `normalized` field on a hybrid hit is now the fused score itself — absolute, comparable across queries, and no longer stretched so the top hit is always `1.0`. A query your catalog answers well and one it cannot answer at all used to return the same number; now they do not. `"bm25"` and `"semantic"` are unchanged. Measured on BFCL before being accepted: better than rank fusion on recall, MRR, and nDCG at every `k`, and the correct answer now scores `0.72` on average where rank fusion returned `0.03` for everything.

## [0.13.0-rc.1] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- `cluster_similarity` and `cluster_coverage` on the adaptive-ranking observation options: the two numbers that draw every cluster boundary. `cluster_similarity` is the minimum cosine a query must clear against a single cluster member, `cluster_coverage` the share of a cluster's members it must clear it against before it joins. Both were fixed constants and both are model- and corpus-dependent — a cosine of 0.70 does not mean the same thing on two embedding models, and a narrow catalog wants different granularity from a broad one — so tuning them is the only way to get sensible clusters out of a catalog whose shape the defaults were not chosen for. Values outside `(0, 1]` raise rather than clamp: a clamp would cluster at something you did not ask for, and boundaries once drawn are never redrawn. Applies to **future** admissions only; a graph keeps reporting the policy it was clustered under, and a mismatch surfaces as the `"active: policy drift"` status, which — unlike a paused status — is not fixed by rebuilding. To re-derive boundaries, replay a trace log or relearn.
- `SearchHit.normalized` and `SkillHit.normalized`: `score` mapped onto `[0, 1]` for display. The raw `score` is on three incomparable scales — unbounded BM25, bounded cosine, and an RRF sum whose magnitude is rank arithmetic — so it has never been displayable, and normalizing it yourself is how a rank position gets read as certainty. Each method now carries the rule its own scale admits: `(cos + 1) / 2` for cosine, `score / Σ idf(query terms)` for raw BM25, and min-max across the full candidate set for RRF. The first two are absolute and compare across queries; the RRF rule does not, because rank fusion has no achievable maximum — a `1.0` there means "best of what came back", not "right". **It is not a confidence:** nothing was fitted to whether the hit was the one you went on to use, so `0.8` does not mean "right 80% of the time".

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Experimental catalog-definition telemetry. `experimental_catalog_definitions=True` publishes change-sensitive `catalog_definition` runtime events; OpenTelemetry export additionally requires `RATEL_EXPERIMENTAL_CATALOG_DEFINITIONS=true` and EventRecord content capture. Definitions use RFC 8785 canonical hashes, omit unsafe numeric schemas, and preserve critical identity fields when payloads are bounded.
- `experimental_searchable_description` on `Tool`, `Skill`, and `Fact` (ADR-0021): an override for the description component BM25 and embeddings actually rank, so retrieval text can be tuned without changing the `description` the model reads or the `body` it receives. Names stay indexed, skill and fact tags stay indexed, and for a tool the override additionally opts that entry out of schema indexing — schemas stay model-facing but stop contributing tokens. Omit it and nothing changes: tools still rank description plus schema tokens, skills and facts still rank their authored description. Experimental, so it may change or be removed without a major-version bump.

  Unlike the Rust core — where the equivalent public field is source-breaking for struct literals — this is additive here. The field is appended last on each dataclass with a `None` default, so every keyword construction is untouched. The one caveat is positional construction of `ExecutableTool`, whose `execute` sits last after the inherited fields and so shifts by one; construct it by keyword, as the SDK and its own docs do everywhere.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- `experimental_record_baseline_turn(query, invoked=..., invoked_skills=...)` records a whole baseline turn in one call, for hosts that cannot hold a turn open while it happens — a process-per-request server where the search and the invocation that follows are different requests, on possibly different machines. Reassemble the turn from your own storage, then hand it over whole. One turn stays one observation: splitting a search with three invocations into three recorded turns counts the query three times, inflating the support that scales the boost and gates the flip. The chained `experimental_baseline_turn` builder is unchanged.

  Collect the lines with the `memory` sink and `drain_trace_events()` at the end of each request, then join them and pass the result to `experimental_build_intent_graph`. The TypeScript SDK additionally offers a `callback` trace sink for hosts sharing one long-lived catalog across concurrent requests, where draining would race; Python has no such sink yet.
- Building a graph from a log now defaults to seeding — `origins: baseline`, `provenance: seeded` — since that is what an offline build is. The common call passes nothing. Enabling live learning still defaults to `any` / `live`; changing that would alter existing behavior. Pass `origins: agent`, `provenance: live` to re-derive a graph from a period when Ratel was already serving.
- `origins` accepts `any` / `agent` / `baseline`. `direct` is a valid search origin but not a filter — learning only from searches your own code made means learning from your plumbing.
- Policy keywords are now `Literal` types (`OriginFilterOption`, `ProvenanceOption`) rather than `str`, so `origins="baselien"` is a type error rather than a runtime one. Runtime validation is unchanged for callers without a type checker.
- `experimental_enable_adaptive_ranking` accepts the same `origins` / `provenance` keywords as `experimental_build_intent_graph`, so what counts as evidence no longer depends on which path produced the graph. Defaults are unchanged, and the policy survives a `set_trace_sink`.
- `experimental_build_intent_graph(jsonl, *, origins, provenance)` on `ToolCatalog` / `ToolRegistry` builds an intent graph from a JSONL trace log, and `experimental_baseline_turn(query)` records a turn observed while Ratel serves no retrieval — name the query, name what the agent invoked, `record()`. The turn is buffered (and usable as a context manager), so a turn that fails your own quality gate is never written. Together they are the seed-first path: capture what an agent invokes on its own, build a graph offline, inspect it, then enable ranking. Every distinct query is embedded up front so clusters form densely; the returned graph is detached, so enabling stays explicit. Policy keywords default to live behavior and reject unknown values.
- `"baseline"` is now a valid `SearchOrigin`, for recording a query while Ratel observes but does not serve retrieval. Unknown origin strings still degrade to `"direct"` rather than failing a search.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Runtime events stream (ADR-0020), mirroring the TypeScript SDK.** `RuntimeEvents` delivers envelope-v2 batches to subscribed handlers (sync or async) for the frozen remotely publishable v1 set `RUNTIME_EVENT_TYPES`, with event ids stable and shared with the OTel projection (`ratel.event.id`). Bounded per-subscriber queues drop oldest and surface losses as `events_dropped`; pre-existing local sinks (memory/JSONL) keep recording synchronously and losslessly. Multi-source subscribe rolls back earlier subscriptions when a later source fails. Imports cleanly on CPython 3.9 (the package floor), now guarded by a real-3.9 CI leg. Exported: `RuntimeEvents`, `RuntimeEvent`, `RuntimeEventHandler`, `RuntimeEventSubscription`, `RuntimeCatalog`, `RUNTIME_EVENT_TYPES`, and the `RUNTIME_EVENT_MAX_*` caps.

### Changed

- The default runtime-events `source_id` now also reads the service name recorded by this SDK's own telemetry configuration: `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, then `service.name` in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, then the name a programmatic `configure_telemetry(service_name=...)` / `ratel_ai_telemetry.init` installed, then `"ratel"` (ADR-0020). Env vars keep precedence, matching the OTel convention; a telemetry helper predating `recorded_service_name()` degrades to the previous behavior. Only deployments that configured telemetry programmatically without passing `source_id` see a different (now correct) identity.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Experimental build-time embedding artifacts (ADR-0018).** `experimental_build_embedding_artifact` builds a mixed Tool+Skill RAT1 (Tool and Skill halves merged internally; no public merge API). Hosts own artifact persistence; the core artifact APIs accept/return bytes and perform no artifact filesystem I/O. Catalogs and registries accept `experimental_embedding_artifact` (`path` or `bytes`; default `on_miss="error"`) and warm on `register` / `replace_all` for any search method before eager document embedding on semantic/hybrid. `ToolRegistry` / `SkillRegistry` expose `experimental_build_embedding_artifact` and `experimental_warm_embeddings_from_artifact`. Failures: `ArtifactWarmError` (`.code`, `.missing` for `"Incomplete"`), `ArtifactError`, and `IncompatibleMergeError` (from incompatible Tool/Skill halves during mixed build — not a public merge function); the high-level builder may also raise `EmbedderError` or `OSError`. Shipped behind an `experimental_` prefix (the API may change until it graduates).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **⚠️ Experimental: facts and grounding (ADR-0017).** The Python mirror of the TS surface. Constant content the agent should always have on hand, registered and monitored like skills, reaching the model on its own host-driven path. Register with `ratel_ai.experimental.FactCatalog`, then pick one of two injection modes per turn: `ground(query, transcript)` persists into your stored history behind a re-injection freshness gate, and `ground_snapshot(query)` is the stateless per-call twin. `Pin.ALWAYS` facts ride every applicable turn; `Pin.RETRIEVED` (the default) surface only when the turn's query ranks them in, budgeted by `facts_top_k` (default 3).
- The freshness gate re-injects a fact only when its body is **absent** from the window (`never` / `evicted`) or has been **edited** (`mutated`) — never merely because a turn elapsed. Presence is the fact's own body text scanned per message: no markers, no tags, no extra tokens. `plan_injection` is the pure decision function behind it, and every decision is traced (`fact_inject` with its reason, `fact_inject_skip`, `fact_snapshot`). `ground()` takes a sequence of per-message strings and rejects a bare `str` with a `TypeError`, since a `str` is itself a `Sequence[str]` and would otherwise be iterated character by character.
- The whole surface lives in the opt-in `ratel_ai.experimental` namespace, never the root package, and constructing a catalog raises a one-time `ExperimentalWarning` (silence with `RATEL_EXPERIMENTAL_SILENCE=1`).

### Changed

- Nothing on the stable path. `search_capabilities` and the capability tools are unchanged from 0.7.0 — the tool result carries no facts, so the model's contract is unchanged.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Whole-catalog skill reload: `SkillCatalog.replace_all` / `SkillRegistry.replace_all` (ADR-0015).** For a source that fetches the full skill catalog rather than individual changes — the batch *is* the catalog, so ids missing from it are removed, including ones registered in-process. Two-phase like `register`: the corpus swap lands **synchronously** (a forgotten `await` never leaves a half-applied reload) and only the embedding pass is awaited, so a reload whose embedding pass fails still reports what the swap changed. Returns a `PendingReplace` carrying the final `added` / `removed` / `updated` / `unchanged` counts; awaiting it drives the embedding pass and resolves to a plain `ReplaceOutcome`. Always `await` the result so an embedding failure raises rather than being swallowed. On failure the new corpus is live and BM25 ranks it while semantic search reports not-built until a later pass succeeds; a reload started while a dense operation owns the registry is rejected rather than blended, and reloading an unchanged catalog costs zero embeddings. `PendingReplace` and `ReplaceOutcome` are exported from `ratel_ai`.
- **`register_mcp_server` follows every `tools/list` page.** Ingestion previously read only the first page, silently dropping every tool past it on a paginated server. It now walks `nextCursor` to exhaustion (treating `""` as a valid cursor, per MCP — only an absent `nextCursor` ends pagination) across `mcp` client versions before and after 1.18, capped at 64 pages. `McpToolsListError` (with a stable `code` of `"RepeatedCursor"` or `"PaginationExceeded"`) is exported from `ratel_ai`, so a cursor loop or a runaway server is a typed failure rather than a hang. `McpServerHandle.tool_ids` now spans all pages in upstream list order.

### Fixed

- Telemetry tool-result capture records only the stable `CallToolResult` fields (`content`, `structuredContent`, `isError`). It previously dumped the whole model, so fields the `mcp` package adds or renames between versions leaked into captured content and made the recorded payload depend on the installed client version.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-28

> **Coming from `0.6.0rc0`?** That RC was tagged off a branch that predated 0.5.2, so it
> shipped neither the `EventRecord` content-capture fixes nor the base `ratel-ai-telemetry`
> runtime dependency. Read the 0.5.2 entry below as part of this upgrade. Upgrades from
> 0.5.2 are unaffected: for them this release is purely additive.

### Added

- **Experimental adaptive usage ranking (ADR-0014).** `IntentGraph` plus `experimental_enable_adaptive_ranking`, `experimental_rebuild_intent_graph`, `experimental_disable_adaptive_ranking`, and `experimental_adaptive_ranking_status` on `ToolCatalog` / `SkillCatalog`. The catalog learns from each search-then-invoke and boosts future rankings; persist and reload via `IntentGraph.to_json` / `from_json`, and track writes via `graph.rev`. Shipped behind an `experimental_` prefix — the API may change until it graduates.
- `rank` and `fused` on search hits: order on `rank`, and branch on `fused` to know whether the usage arm changed the ranking.
- Opt-in recovery after an embedding-model change: `experimental_enable_adaptive_ranking(graph, rebuild_on_model_change=True)` re-embeds a paused graph on the next dense search. Default off; explicit `experimental_rebuild_intent_graph()` otherwise. `experimental_adaptive_ranking_status` returns an `AdaptiveRankingStatus` that carries the paused/active state and the mismatched-model detail.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- `configure_telemetry(endpoint=...)` now defaults to `RATEL_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, falling back to the superseded `RATEL_URL` with a `DeprecationWarning`. `RATEL_URL` also selects the catalog source (ADR-0003), so it no longer doubles as the OTLP destination. Resolution lives in `ratel-ai-telemetry>=0.1.3`; nothing breaks here, a `RATEL_URL`-only install keeps exporting to the same endpoint.

### Fixed

- Emit content capture as structured OpenTelemetry Logs `EventRecord`s, keep tool results out of inference-output messages, and export those records through `configure_telemetry()`.
- Serialize real MCP `CallToolResult` values into telemetry instead of recording an empty string.
- Preserve heterogeneous JSON arrays losslessly despite OpenTelemetry Python 1.41's
  homogeneous-array limitation.
- Ship and require the OTel-free telemetry vocabulary version that defines the EventRecord
  contract, so base installs emit into host-owned OpenTelemetry providers.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Ship the native extension built with symbol stripping and thin LTO (`[profile.release]`), materially shrinking the wheel's compiled binary. No API or behavior change.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- `register()` accepts a single item or an iterable across tool/skill registries and catalogs.
- Configurable default, HuggingFace, local Candle, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint embedding sources, with public `EmbeddingSpec`,
  `EmbeddingModelConfig`, and source-specific `TypedDict` variants.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `register()` now accepts a single tool/skill **or an iterable of them** and folds embedding in, returning an awaitable (`Awaitable[None]`): on a `"semantic"`/`"hybrid"` catalog it embeds the batch off the asyncio loop (GIL released), so embedding errors (model load / endpoint / auth / dimension) surface from `await register(...)`. A `"bm25"` catalog registers metadata only and never loads a model. `search()` stays synchronous BM25-only; `search_async()` covers BM25/semantic/hybrid. There is **no** `register_many()`, `build_embeddings()`, or `rebuild_embeddings()` — `register()` embeds, and recovery from a model/dimension change is to construct a new catalog and re-register.
- Capability tools await async retrieval; MCP ingestion embeds ingested tools during `register`.
- Embedding configuration is validated and retained on BM25-default catalogs for later async semantic/hybrid overrides; typed config variants are mutually exclusive.

### Fixed

- A forgotten `await` on `register()` no longer silently drops the corpus: an un-awaited call still registers the tools/skills (BM25 keeps working), and a `"semantic"`/`"hybrid"` `search_async` after an un-awaited `register()` raises an actionable "not awaited" error instead of ranking an empty corpus.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- `configure_telemetry()` returns a per-call shutdown handle (`handle.shutdown()` / `handle.force_flush()`) on every path — the no-override path no longer leaks `init()`'s shared provider directly. Because that provider is shared across callers, shutting one handle down stops export for all of them.

### Fixed

- `configure_telemetry()` no longer mutates a shared provider's `shutdown` method. When idempotent telemetry initialization reuses one provider, a stale handle can no longer clear a newer caller's generation-scoped content-capture override.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `configure_telemetry` opts into message/tool content capture programmatically: `capture_content` sets the exact `ContentCapture` mode (validated like the env var — case-insensitive, legacy boolean forms accepted — raising a `ValueError` on garbage before any exporter is wired), and `include_span_and_events` is boolean sugar (`True` → `SPAN_AND_EVENT`, `False` → `NO_CONTENT`). `capture_content` wins over `include_span_and_events`; when neither is provided, `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` keeps ruling (a provided option beats the env var, as in OTel code-over-env precedence). The returned provider's `shutdown()` restores env-driven behavior via a generation-scoped clear (`clear_content_capture`), so a stale handle shutting down late never clobbers an override a newer `configure_telemetry` installed. The `set_content_capture` / `clear_content_capture` / `ContentCapture` primitives live in `ratel_ai_telemetry`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **OpenTelemetry emission.** The SDK now opens an OTel span at each funnel boundary — `execute_tool` (`gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.tool.name`, `ratel.tool.args_size_bytes`), `ratel.search` (target, `top_k`, origin, `hit_count`), `ratel.skill.load`, `ratel.upstream.register`, and `ratel.auth.flow` — alongside the existing local `record_event` stream, which is unchanged. Emission is transparent and free by default: the `opentelemetry` API and the vocabulary are imported lazily, so the base (dependency-free) install is a pure pass-through no-op, and when OpenTelemetry is present the spans flow to whatever provider is registered. Built on the OTel-free `ratel_ai_telemetry` vocabulary, so the base install stays dependency-free.
- `configure_telemetry(api_key=..., endpoint=..., headers=..., service_name=...)` convenience wiring, exported from `ratel_ai`: installs a Ratel-owned OTLP exporter (via the new `[otlp]` extra, `pip install 'ratel-ai[otlp]'`) that ships the SDK's spans to Ratel Cloud (or any OTLP endpoint) and returns the provider as a shutdown handle. Hosts already running OpenTelemetry skip it and add `ratel_span_processor` from `ratel_ai_telemetry` instead.
- Message/tool content (`ratel.search.query`, `gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` / `.result`) rides span attributes only when `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` selects a span mode (`SPAN_ONLY` / `SPAN_AND_EVENT`); default off.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- `ToolCatalog` / `SkillCatalog` accept a default `method` (`"bm25"` | `"semantic"` | `"hybrid"`) and `search(query, top_k, origin=..., method=...)` takes a per-call override. `"bm25"` (default) is unchanged and model-free; `"semantic"` / `"hybrid"` load a local embedding model and raise `RuntimeError` if it fails to load. Exposed via the native `search_with_method` binding and the `SearchMethod` type.
- A `"semantic"`/`"hybrid"` catalog embeds each tool/skill **eagerly at `register`** (incrementally), so searches never pay the corpus-embedding cost. New `catalog.build_embeddings()` pre-computes embeddings on demand (e.g. after a bulk register). BM25 catalogs do neither. A semantic/hybrid search on a catalog with no embeddings built raises `RuntimeError` (embeddings not computed) rather than embedding during the search.

## [0.2.1-rc.1] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- First release cut under the per-package release scheme (ADR-0008): `ratel-ai` now versions and ships independently of the core crate and JS SDK, tagged `sdk-py-v*`. No API changes since 0.2.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `search_tools_tool` → `search_capabilities_tool` (`SEARCH_TOOLS_ID` → `SEARCH_CAPABILITIES_ID`). It now returns two independently-ranked buckets — `{ tools, skills }`. Brings the Python SDK to parity with the TypeScript SDK. The old `search_tools_tool`/`SEARCH_TOOLS_ID` are kept as deprecated aliases (see _Deprecated_), so `0.1.x` code keeps working after upgrading.

### Added

- First-class **skills**: `SkillCatalog`, `Skill`, `get_skill_content_tool` (`get_skill_content`), and the native `SkillRegistry`/`SkillHit` — the on-demand skill analogue of the tool catalog, ranked by a separate BM25 corpus.
- Skill–tool coupling: a `Skill` can declare a `tools` list, and `search_capabilities` pulls a matched skill's declared tools into the `tools` bucket — additively (beyond `topKTools`) and deduped against query hits — so the agent gets the playbook and the tools it needs in one turn.

### Deprecated

- `search_tools_tool` and `SEARCH_TOOLS_ID`. They retain their pre-0.2.0 behaviour — a tools-only `{groups}` result and the `search_tools` id — so upgrading from `0.1.x` does not break existing callers. Migrate to `search_capabilities_tool`; the aliases will be removed in a future release.

### Fixed

- Gateway error payloads carry `isError: True`; `invoke_tool` rejects a non-object `args` instead of forwarding stray top-level keys.
- `search_capabilities_tool` validates `topKTools`/`topKSkills` (declared `integer`, positive): `0`, negative, `bool`, and `float` fall back to the default, matching the TypeScript SDK exactly.
- `search_capabilities_tool` advertises the `skills` bucket and `get_skill_content` in its description only when a non-empty `SkillCatalog` is provided.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Initial release of the Python SDK. Binds the Rust core (`ratel-ai-core`) via PyO3, distributed as prebuilt `abi3` wheels for darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64-gnu, linux-arm64-gnu, and win32-x64-msvc — no Rust toolchain required to install. (`v0.1.5` shipped TS-only on 2026-05-10; the first release carrying Python is the next version bump.) Binding strategy locked in [ADR-0006](../../../docs/adr/0006-native-ffi-bindings.md).
- Full feature parity with the TypeScript SDK (`@ratel-ai/sdk`):
  - `ToolRegistry` / `SearchHit` — metadata-only BM25 index (native).
  - `ToolCatalog` accepts a `trace` config (`noop` default, `memory`, or `jsonl`); captured events flow through the Rust core sink ([ADR-0007](../../../docs/adr/0007-telemetry-two-streams.md)). Exposes `record_event`, `drain_trace_events`, and an `origin` argument on `search`. `invoke` emits `invoke_start` / `invoke_end` / `invoke_error` with `args_size_bytes` and `took_ms`, and awaits coroutine executors.
  - `search_tools_tool` / `invoke_tool_tool` gateway factories with verbatim descriptions and JSON schemas from the TS SDK. `search_tools_tool` emits `gateway_search` with `origin: "agent"`; `invoke_tool_tool` emits `gateway_invoke` / `gateway_error` and handles the `needs_auth` / `on_unauthorized` path.
  - `register_mcp_server` ingests an upstream MCP `ClientSession` (optional `mcp` extra, `pip install 'ratel-ai[mcp]'`), namespacing tool ids as `<server>__<tool>` and emitting `upstream_register` / `upstream_invoke` / `upstream_error`.
- Ships type stubs (`_native.pyi`, `py.typed`) for a fully typed install.
