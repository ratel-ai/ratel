# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ratel-ai/mastra` are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this package adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0-rc.1] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Each Mastra generation is one Ratel turn ([ADR 0026](../../../docs/adr/0026-turn-scope.md)) with no wiring beyond `recallProcessor()`: it opens the turn, or joins the host's own `r.turn(...)`, and the generation's searches and tool calls carry its `turn_id`. Tools the Agent holds beside Ratel's are recorded as external tool calls as they complete.
- `mastra({ captureUserMessage: true })` sends the user's last message on `turn_start`. Off by default.
- Needs `@ratel-ai/sdk` with the turn scope; against an older SDK the adapter behaves as before.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Preserve a tool's experimental searchable-description projection while ingesting Mastra definitions, allowing protocol-v2 retrieval text to differ from the model-facing description.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- `@ratel-ai/mastra/observability` now exports `experimentalRatelSpanOutputProcessor()`, which copies the active retrieval experiment's five controlled baggage fields onto Mastra's private spans for exact cross-stream joins while preserving Mastra's independent telemetry pipeline.

### Fixed

- The published `@ratel-ai/sdk` peer is now the floor range `>=0.11.0 <1.0.0` instead of a caret of the in-repo SDK version.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- The `@ratel-ai/sdk` peer range moves to `^0.6.0`, tracking the SDK release that adds experimental adaptive usage ranking. The adapter's own API is unchanged, and 0.6.0 is additive over 0.5.2 — the range moves because at 0.x a caret does not span minors, so `^0.5.2` excludes `0.6.x`. npm resolves peers automatically, which makes that mismatch an install-time `ERESOLVE` rather than a warning: `@ratel-ai/mastra@0.1.0` cannot be installed alongside `@ratel-ai/sdk@0.6.x`, and this release cannot be installed alongside `@ratel-ai/sdk@0.5.x`. Staying on the 0.5 SDK means staying on adapter 0.1.0.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Initial release: `@ratel-ai/mastra`, the [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) (`@mastra/core`) adapter for Ratel. `ratel(config).adaptTo(mastra())` speaks Mastra's native `Tool` (from `createTool`) and `MastraDBMessage` shapes through the framework-adapter SPI (ADR-0013): the `ingest` / `expose` / `recallMessages` codecs plus a per-turn recall idiom — `recallProcessor()`, a Mastra `Processor` you drop into an Agent's `inputProcessors`. `ingest` reads Mastra's normalized input schema (so zod 3, zod 4, and raw JSON Schema tools all work); `expose` wraps the three capability tools as genuine `createTool` results; `recallMessages` encodes the synthetic `search_capabilities` call+result as one assistant message (`content.format: 2`, a single resolved `tool-invocation` part). Tool execution preserves Mastra's complete live `ToolExecutionContext` through `invoke_tool` — `requestContext`, workspace, agent thread/resource metadata, `mastra`, and `abortSignal` — so `requestContextSchema` values validate against the caller's real context and concurrent invocations stay isolated (direct `ToolCatalog.invoke` calls use the documented context-free fallback). Peers `@mastra/core@>=1.11.0 <2` (the adapter owns its no-op observer and validation-error guard locally, and is CI-tested against 1.11.0, 1.31.0, and 1.51.0), `zod@^3.25.0 || ^4.0.0`, and `@ratel-ai/sdk` (Node.js ≥ 22.13.0) with zero runtime dependencies; passes the `@ratel-ai/sdk/testkit` conformance battery.
