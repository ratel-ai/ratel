# `@ratel-ai/mastra`

The [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) (`@mastra/core`) adapter for [Ratel](https://github.com/ratel-ai/ratel). `ratel(config).adaptTo(mastra())` layers a framework-shaped view over the framework-neutral core (ADR-0013), so a Mastra agent registers its own `createTool()`s, hands the model Ratel's capability funnel, and gets per-turn recall — all in Mastra's native `Tool` and `MastraDBMessage` shapes, with no glue in app code.

Ratel keeps the model's tool list small and stable: instead of advertising every tool, it exposes three capability tools (`search_capabilities` / `invoke_tool` / `get_skill_content`) and injects a ranked, per-turn `search_capabilities` result for the current user message. The core owns all state and every guard (reserved ids, top-K clamp, first-registration-wins, recall-id counter); the adapter is just three codecs plus one recall idiom.

## Usage

```ts
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { mastra } from "@ratel-ai/mastra";
import { ratel } from "@ratel-ai/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

const r = ratel({ method: "hybrid", recallTopK: 5 }).adaptTo(mastra());

// Register the app's Mastra tools into the shared catalog (any time, also after
// modelTools()). Tools without an `execute` (client/provider-executed) pass through eagerly.
r.tools.register({
  weather: createTool({
    id: "weather",
    description: "Get the weather in a location",
    inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
    execute: async ({ location }) => ({ location, tempF: 72 }),
  }),
});

const agent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "assistant",
  instructions: "Help the user with their tasks.",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  // The three capability tools in Mastra shape. Take the set ONCE per agent and
  // reuse it: it never changes across turns, so the prompt cache survives.
  tools: r.modelTools(),
  // Rank the catalog for each user turn and inject the synthetic search_capabilities
  // call+result before the model runs (recall mode).
  inputProcessors: [r.recallProcessor()],
});

const result = await agent.generate("what's the weather in Paris?");
console.log(result.text);
```

To experimentally tune retrieval without changing the description sent to the model, attach an explicit override to the constructed tool: `Object.assign(createTool({...}), { experimentalSearchableDescription: "forecast conditions" })`. The adapter forwards it to Ratel and leaves the Mastra description untouched. This surface may change without a major-version bump.

Standalone (framework-free) use of the same core is also fine — `r` is `ratel(config)` before `.adaptTo`, exposing native `ExecutableTool`s. See [`@ratel-ai/sdk`](../../sdk/ts/README.md).

## The `recallProcessor()` idiom

`r.recallProcessor()` returns a fresh Mastra [`Processor`](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/input-processors) each call (so several agents each get their own). It implements `processInput`, which Mastra runs **once at the start of every generation** — i.e. once per user turn. On each turn it:

1. reads the last message's text iff that message is the user's turn (multi-part text joins with newlines);
2. ranks the catalog with the core's `recall(query)`;
3. if there are hits, appends the synthetic `search_capabilities` call+result to the messages the model sees.

It is a no-op — spending no recall-id — when the last message is not a user turn, the user text is empty, or nothing matched. Because `processInput` runs once per generation (not per step), the pair is injected once and is **not** re-injected during the agent's tool-call loop.

## One turn per generation

Each `agent.generate()` / `agent.stream()` is one Ratel turn with no extra code beyond
`recallProcessor()`: it opens the turn, and the generation's searches and tool calls carry its
`turn_id` (keyed by the generation's `requestContext`, so pass a fresh one per call if you pass your
own). If you already wrap the call in `r.turn(...)` (to set `endUserId` or your own id), the adapter
joins that turn. Tools the Agent holds beside `r.modelTools()` are recorded as external tool calls as
they complete; Mastra does not mark a failed call in its transcript, so they all record as
completed, without durations, and the last step's calls are not seen.

The user's message is not sent unless you opt in: `mastra({ captureUserMessage: true })`. Needs an
`@ratel-ai/sdk` with the turn scope; on an older SDK the adapter behaves as before.

## Limitations

- **Single-message recall encoding.** A `MastraDBMessage` has no `tool` role: a completed call+result is one assistant message with `content.format: 2` and a single resolved `tool-invocation` part. The recall pair is therefore encoded as **one** assistant message (Mastra renders it to the model as an assistant tool-call followed by a tool result).
- **Direct catalog invocation has no Mastra context.** The normal model path through `invoke_tool` forwards Mastra's complete live `ToolExecutionContext` unchanged, including `requestContext`, workspace, agent thread/resource metadata, `mastra`, and `abortSignal`; `requestContextSchema` therefore validates against the caller's real values. The driver-level escape hatch `r.tools.catalog.invoke(id, args)` bypasses a Mastra invocation, so it retains a minimal fallback context (`{ observe }` no-op, a fresh empty `requestContext`, other live fields absent). Pass tools through `modelTools()` when they depend on request-scoped context.
- **Any Mastra tool schema works.** `ingest` reads Mastra's *already-normalized* input schema, so tools built with zod 3, zod 4, or a raw JSON Schema all catalog correctly — the adapter never re-converts schemas itself. (`zod` is a peer only because the exposed capability tools carry hand-written zod schemas.)
- **Persist the conversation across turns.** Recall fires only when the last message is the user's turn. Standard Mastra memory hygiene applies; if you rebuild the message history per call, keep the user turn last so recall can find it.

## Telemetry

Ratel's side needs no wiring, here as everywhere: `@ratel-ai/sdk` emits its `ratel.*` spans onto
whatever OpenTelemetry provider is registered globally and registers none itself, so a host that
runs a `NodeSDK` at all gets the retrieval and tool-execution spans for free, and with no
provider they are no-ops. Span inventory and host wiring: [`src/telemetry/`](../../telemetry/README.md).

What is specific to Mastra is that the two streams do **not** share a pipeline. Mastra's AI
tracing is a private one: it never registers a global provider — so there is no fight with the
host's `NodeSDK` — but its spans never pass through the host's span processors either, leaving
over its exporter's own socket instead. Two parallel egress paths, and no shared trace ids unless
Mastra's own OTel bridge joins the trees. An un-instrumented Mastra emits no private spans, so
until its side is configured, Ratel's spans are all a host gets.

The opt-in `@ratel-ai/mastra/observability` entrypoint adds experiment joins to that private
stream:

```bash
pnpm add @mastra/observability @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/context-async-hooks
```

```ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { Observability } from "@mastra/observability";
import { context } from "@opentelemetry/api";
import { AsyncLocalStorageContextManager } from "@opentelemetry/context-async-hooks";
import { experimentalRatelSpanOutputProcessor } from "@ratel-ai/mastra/observability";

// Required even when no exporter is configured: baggage propagation depends on it.
context.setGlobalContextManager(new AsyncLocalStorageContextManager().enable());

const observability = new Observability({
  configs: {
    default: {
      serviceName: "my-agent",
      exporters: [/* the host's Mastra exporters */],
      spanOutputProcessors: [experimentalRatelSpanOutputProcessor()],
    },
  },
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({ observability });
```

Add the processor to every Mastra observability config that should carry experiment joins. It
captures the active arm on a span's first processor pass and copies the five controlled
`ratel.experiment.*` fields (`id`, `selection_id`, `arm`, `role`, `unit`) onto that span. Baggage
values win collisions; unrelated Mastra attributes remain. Put it after any custom processor
that rewrites those keys. Mastra sampling and internal/excluded-span filters still decide which
spans reach processors.

The Mastra operation must **start inside the experiment arm callback**. Calling
`agent.generate()` after `experiment.select()` returns is too late: the arm context has ended.
Without a Mastra OTel bridge, the SDK and Mastra streams keep separate trace ids; join them by the
five experiment attributes. The processor neither installs a bridge nor changes exporters.
Executable Mastra tools already traverse Ratel's invocation funnel through `invoke_tool`.
Provider/client tools with no `execute` remain outside that SDK funnel, although any private
Mastra span they produce can still receive the experiment join.

## Package shape

- Package name: `@ratel-ai/mastra`
- Pure TypeScript. The root adapter remains glue over host peers: `@mastra/core@>=1.11.0 <2`, `zod@^3.25.0 || ^4.0.0` (matching Mastra's own zod peer), and `@ratel-ai/sdk`. The package carries only the OTel-free `@ratel-ai/telemetry` vocabulary; the opt-in `./observability` entrypoint additionally peers optionally on `@opentelemetry/api`.
- Live context forwarding spans this adapter and `@ratel-ai/sdk`; upgrade their RCs together. An older SDK silently drops the adapter's opaque context before catalog execution.
- Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer, matching Mastra's own requirement.
- MIT ([ADR-0009](../../../docs/adr/0009-licensing.md)); member of the pnpm workspace; `publishConfig` provenance on.

## Mastra compatibility

The supported range is `@mastra/core@>=1.11.0 <2`. Version 1.11 is the floor because it is the first 1.x release where `createTool()` normalizes zod and raw JSON schemas to the Standard Schema surface that `ingest` reads.

There is no runtime version detection. The adapter stays on the common public tool, message, processor, `SpanOutputProcessor`, and `ToolExecutionContext` shapes and owns small compatibility details locally: the direct-call no-op observer fallback, structural validation-error check, and structural span-output processor type. The latter avoids importing `@mastra/core/observability`, a subpath that Mastra 1.11 did not export even though the processor contract already existed. This also avoids imports that Mastra only exported later (`isValidationError` in 1.18 and `noopObserve` in 1.37) while preserving their behavior. CI runs the adapter build, suite, and type tests against exact 1.11.0, 1.31.0, and 1.51.0; the worked Mastra example also drives a real 1.51 Agent loop.

## Build & test

From the repo root (the SDK is built first by `pnpm -r build`, which the tests import):

```bash
pnpm --filter @ratel-ai/mastra build
pnpm --filter @ratel-ai/mastra typecheck
pnpm --filter @ratel-ai/mastra lint
pnpm --filter @ratel-ai/mastra test
```

The suite covers the three codecs, the recall processor (including id economy on the no-op paths), experiment joins through a real SDK arm context, a mock-model integration test that drives the real Mastra `Agent` loop, a compile-only type-test locking the supported `@mastra/core` surface, and the `@ratel-ai/sdk/testkit` conformance battery (22 cases, 0 skipped). CI repeats it against the minimum Mastra release.
