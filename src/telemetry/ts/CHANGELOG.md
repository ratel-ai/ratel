# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ratel-ai/telemetry` are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this package adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2-rc.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- `API_KEY_ENV` (`RATEL_API_KEY`) and API-key environment fallback in `resolveOtlpConfig`. An explicit `apiKey` remains authoritative; the env fallback applies only when neither `apiKey` nor an explicit `Authorization` header is given, so ambient `RATEL_API_KEY` never clobbers a caller-supplied auth header.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `setContentCapture(mode)`: programmatic override of the content-capture gate. While set, `contentCaptureMode()` returns the given mode regardless of `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` — code-level config wins over the environment, matching how OpenTelemetry treats env vars as the fallback for programmatic configuration. The mode is validated exactly like the env var (case-insensitive, trimmed, legacy `true`/`false`/`1`/`0` forms accepted) and throws a `TypeError` naming the valid values on anything unrecognized — failing loud at config time instead of storing a value that would both disable capture and mask the env var. Pass `null`/`undefined` to clear unconditionally. Returns a generation token identifying the call as the current owner of the override.
- `clearContentCapture(generation)`: clears the override only when `generation` (the token returned by `setContentCapture`) still identifies the most recent set. A stale token no-ops, so an old telemetry handle shutting down late cannot clobber an override a newer caller installed and silently flip capture back to the env value.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- The telemetry helper (ADR-0015): the full `ratel.*` vocabulary as constants (attribute keys, span/event names, `gen_ai.*` interop keys, and the `Origin`/`SearchTarget`/`AuthOutcome` value enums) pinned to OpenTelemetry semconv `gen_ai` v1.42.0.
- Shared contract-against-the-pin conformance suite (`../conformance/fixtures.json`): spans built from the constants through the real SDK must emit the exact pinned keys.
- Usage example in the README (runnable end-to-end in `examples/telemetry-ts`).
- A regression guard that no `@opentelemetry/*` runtime dependency or shipped-source import can creep back into the vocabulary package.

### Changed

- `init()` lives in [`@ratel-ai/telemetry-otlp`](../ts-otlp/README.md), not this package: importing `@ratel-ai/telemetry` pulls no OpenTelemetry SDK (ADR-0015), so the SDK (emit), the server (read), and edge/serverless emitters take the `ratel.*` vocabulary weight-free. This package keeps the constants plus the pure `resolveOtlpConfig` / `contentCaptureMode`; callers of `init()` install `@ratel-ai/telemetry-otlp` and import it from there.
- Released as an independent npm unit under the `telemetry-ts-v*` tag prefix.
