# Changelog

All notable changes to `ratel-ai-telemetry` (the Rust telemetry constants crate) are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this package adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- `GEN_AI_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS`, `GEN_AI_INPUT_MESSAGES`, `GEN_AI_OUTPUT_MESSAGES`, and
  `RATEL_TOOL_EXECUTION_DETAILS` EventRecord constants.

### Changed

- Clarify that content events use the OpenTelemetry Logs Event API and that inference output messages require `finish_reason`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- The telemetry vocabulary (ADR-0015): the full `ratel.*` constants (attribute keys, span/event names, `gen_ai.*` interop keys, and the `Origin`/`SearchTarget`/`AuthOutcome` value enums) pinned to OpenTelemetry semconv `gen_ai` v1.42.0, as zero-dependency `&str` constants and enums.
- The `contract-against-the-pin` test suite: every constant is asserted against its pinned wire key, so the vocabulary cannot drift from `CONVENTIONS.md`.

### Changed

- Released as an independent crates.io unit under the `telemetry-core-v*` tag prefix.

This crate is constants-only; the TS and Python helpers ship `init()`.
