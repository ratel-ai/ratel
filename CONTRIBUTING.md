# Contributing to Ratel

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) v2.1. By participating, you're agreeing to abide by it. Report incidents to `conduct@ratel.sh`.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** stable — pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup picks it up automatically.
- **Node** 24+
- **pnpm** 10.28+ (see `packageManager` in `package.json`)

## Build & test

```bash
# Rust
cargo build --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check --all
cargo test --workspace

# TS
pnpm install
pnpm -r build
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint
pnpm -r test
```

CI (`.github/workflows/{rust,ts}.yml`) runs all of the above on every PR. PRs are expected to land green.

## Branching

- `main` — stable
- `revamp` — v1 line, current development target until cutover
- Branch off `revamp` for new work; PR back into `revamp`

## Backend before frontend

For features that aren't frontend-only, implement on the Rust core first (with tests), then surface in the TS SDK.

## TDD

Backend / business-logic / library code: TDD is the default — write the failing test first, make it pass, refactor. Frontend changes don't require TDD unless they encode business logic.

## Additive, non-breaking evolution

Avoid breaking changes wherever avoidable. Ship new capabilities as additive, clearly-named experimental surfaces — an `experimentalSomething` function/method or a feature flag (e.g. `experimentalAsyncBuildEmbeddings`) — alongside the stable path, so existing callers keep working while the new behavior is proven out. Once it's proven, promote it to stable (drop the `experimental` prefix) or remove it; don't leave `experimental*` surfaces to rot.

## Architecture decisions

For cross-cutting choices, write an ADR in `docs/adr/` — Nygard format (`Status` / `Context` / `Decision` / `Consequences`), next available number, kebab-cased title. The set is kept minimal and current: amend in place for small drift (paths, names, counts), supersede for real decision reversals, compact periodically (git history is the archive). See [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) for the full convention.

## Commit messages

- Concise, imperative mood; sacrifice grammar for brevity
- Conventional-commits-ish prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `ci:`) where useful — the prefix picks the CHANGELOG section (`feat`→Added, `fix`→Fixed, `perf`/`refactor`→Changed; `docs`/`chore`/`ci`/`build`/`test` are skipped). See Releases
- A scope (`feat(core):`, `fix(sdk):`) is cosmetic — it's shown in the entry but does not decide which unit's CHANGELOG a commit lands in. That routing is by the files a commit touches (git-cliff scopes each unit to its own paths), so keep a commit within one unit's tree where practical
- No tool-attribution lines (no `Co-Authored-By` for AI assistants)

## Releases

Independently-versioned units publish from this repo (ADR-0008): `ratel-ai-core` (crates.io, `core-v*`), `@ratel-ai/sdk` + its per-OS packages (npm, `sdk-ts-v*`), `ratel-ai` (PyPI, `sdk-py-v*`), and the four telemetry units — `ratel-ai-telemetry` (crates.io, `telemetry-core-v*`), `@ratel-ai/telemetry` (npm, `telemetry-ts-v*`), `ratel-ai-telemetry` (PyPI, `telemetry-py-v*`), and the `init()` exporter `@ratel-ai/telemetry-otlp` (npm, `telemetry-ts-otlp-v*`). Each has a `CHANGELOG.md` in its package directory and its own tag prefix. `@ratel-ai/mcp-server` publishes independently from [ratel-ai/ratel-mcp](https://github.com/ratel-ai/ratel-mcp).

To cut a release — one unit at a time; see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the full flow:

1. `node scripts/releasable.mjs` to see which units have unreleased commits.
2. Bump that unit's version in its manifest(s) — the release workflow validates the tag against every manifest the unit owns.
3. Run the `/changelog` skill (`.claude/skills/changelog/`) for the unit. It drafts entries with [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org), lets you curate, and writes the unit's CHANGELOG; for GA versions it collapses the unit's `## [X.Y.Z-rc.*]` sections into a single `## [X.Y.Z]`.
4. Commit the bump + CHANGELOG together (`release: <unit>-vX.Y.Z`), tag `<unit>-vX.Y.Z`, push.

The release workflow's `tag-version-check` job rejects any tag whose unit CHANGELOG lacks a `## [<version>]` heading. See [ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-release-engineering.md) (per-unit versions, tags, and CHANGELOG gates) for the rationale.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR
- Update `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the same PR if the change affects them
- Tag `@claude` to invoke automated review on GitHub if useful
