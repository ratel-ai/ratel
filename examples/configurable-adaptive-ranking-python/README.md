# `examples/configurable-adaptive-ranking-python` — seed adaptive ranking from a baseline capture

The Python mirror of [`examples/configurable-adaptive-ranking-ts`](../configurable-adaptive-ranking-ts/README.md). Shows the **seed-first** path for [adaptive usage ranking](../../docs/adr/0014-adaptive-usage-ranking.md): record what an agent invokes while Ratel serves nothing, build an intent graph from that log offline, inspect it, and only then switch ranking on. **No model or API key** — a pure-Ratel feature demo over BM25.

> **Phases A–D only.** The TypeScript demo has a fifth phase, recapturing the same turns from a host where no single process sees a whole turn. Python has the API that needs — `experimental_record_baseline_turn` — but not the `callback` trace sink, so a Python host collects lines with the `memory` sink and `drain_trace_events()` per request instead. Everything through phase D behaves identically in both.

The plain adaptive-ranking demo ([`examples/adaptive-ranking-python`](../adaptive-ranking-python/README.md)) learns live, starting from an empty graph. This one starts from evidence Ratel had no hand in.

## Why seed first

Adaptive ranking learns from what the agent invokes. But once Ratel is ranking, what the agent invokes is partly Ratel's own doing — ADR-0014 concedes the loop: *"boosting used capabilities makes them more used."* And a fresh deployment gets no boost at all until enough pairs accumulate.

Capturing first fixes both. An agent choosing from its own full tool list, with Ratel nowhere in the ranking path, produces the cleanest evidence available — and enough of it to be useful on day one.

The catch: a graph is keyed on query text, and a run where nobody searches has no query. So the host records each turn's text alongside the invocations, and Ratel stays a recorder.

## Setup

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Expected output — the graph matures as turns are captured, then the flip:

```

```

BM25 ranks `docker_build` first for *"why is the build broken"* on the token *build*. Ten turns across three intents say people reach for `gh_run_list` on build questions, and the seeded graph closes the gap — with no live learning in between.

The intents interleave, so you can watch clusters form and reach full strength at different points: the build cluster at turn 3, the key-rotation one at turn 8, and file reading still ramping when capture ends.

## The four phases

### A. Collect

Ratel is a tape recorder: no graph attached, no learner, no embedder, no search on the turn path. `ranking status: inactive` throughout.

```python
capture = await build_catalog(
    TraceSinkConfig(kind="jsonl", session_id="session-1", path=str(log_path))
)

capture.experimental_baseline_turn(turn).invoked(invoked).record()

# or, gated on your own success signal:
with capture.experimental_baseline_turn(turn) as t:
    t.invoked(invoked)     # records on a clean exit, discards if the block raises
```

Two rules:

- **The turn is the unit.** Nothing reaches the log until `record()`, so skipping it is how you drop a turn you would not want the graph to learn from. Success is not observable from a trace, so that gate is yours — seed from an agent you already trust.
- **One query, N invocations.** Everything named on a turn attributes to its query; the graph counts one observation and one edge per capability.

### B. Build

```python
# Both knobs default to seeding, so the common call passes nothing.
graph = await serving.experimental_build_intent_graph(log_path.read_text())
```

Every distinct query is embedded up front, so clusters form at the **dense** tier — the same tier the live path uses. That is why this lives on the catalog: a model-free replay would cluster on word overlap, and `experimental_rebuild_intent_graph` cannot repair it later (it replaces centroids without revisiting cluster boundaries).

One call covers both catalogs — a log carrying tool *and* skill events fills both edge maps.

### C. Inspect

The returned graph is **detached**. Building never switches ranking on, so inspecting first is the default rather than something you opt into. The example prints each cluster's label, its observations, and which tools it remembers.

### D. Serve

```python
serving.experimental_enable_adaptive_ranking(graph)
```

From here the live learner keeps adding to the same graph. `support` grows while `seeded_support` stays put, so the gap between them tells you how much of each cluster still rests on the baseline versus what live traffic has since confirmed.

## Policy options

`experimental_build_intent_graph` takes the same two keywords everywhere; each defaults to reproducing live behavior.

| Keyword | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `origins` | `any` \| `agent` \| `baseline` | `baseline` |
| `provenance` | `live` \| `seeded` | `seeded` |

`experimental_enable_adaptive_ranking` takes two more, which decide how clusters are drawn rather than which evidence enters them.

| Keyword | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `cluster_similarity` | `(0, 1]` | `0.70` |
| `cluster_coverage` | `(0, 1]` | `0.5` |

`cluster_similarity` is how close a query must be to a single cluster member; `cluster_coverage` is the share of members it must be that close to. Raise the first if clusters swallow unrelated questions; lower it if obvious paraphrases land apart. The right value is model- and corpus-dependent, which is why it is a knob at all.

**Tuning does not re-cluster.** Existing boundaries stay as they are — nothing can redraw them in place — so a change applies to later queries only. The graph records the policy it was clustered under and reports `"active: policy drift"` when they differ; re-deriving boundaries means replaying a log through `experimental_build_intent_graph`, or relearning.

Unknown values raise `ValueError` rather than silently defaulting: a policy is a deliberate configuration, and reading `"seedd"` as `"live"` would produce a graph with no provenance and no error.

## Watching it mature

`experimental_build_intent_graph` is a **pure function of (log, policy)** returning a detached graph, so you can rebuild from the log so far as often as you like while capture continues. The demo does exactly that — it scores after every captured turn, so the progression is visible inline rather than in a separate script. That makes the "when do we flip?" decision measurable rather than a guess.

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `clusters` | distinct intents found so far |
| `support` | observations behind the cluster **this turn landed in**, out of the 3 that reach full strength — below that the boost is scaled down proportionally |
| `obs` | confirmed observations across every cluster |
| `from_baseline` | how many of those came from this capture rather than live traffic; after the flip it stays put while `obs` keeps growing |
| `coverage` | held-out queries that matched a cluster — **none of them a captured turn**. The one to gate on: the others rise whether or not the graph generalises, so a healthy-looking graph can still fire on none of your traffic |

**Gate on coverage.** Measured on a real embedding model against invented agent-style queries, a graph seeded from user turn text matched 9 of 13 — and the misses clustered entirely in one intent, where users described a *symptom* ("why is the build broken") while the agent searched by *action* ("list ci workflow runs"). Whether your traffic looks like that is not predictable from outside, and no other column tells you.

Treat them as a report for a person to read, not an auto-trigger.

### Rough edges

- **`SUPPORT_FULL` is not exposed.** The demo hardcodes `3`. The threshold is Ratel's, so you should not have to know it — a first-class readiness API is still to come.
- **Rebuilding is O(whole log).** Fine nightly or every few hundred turns; wasteful per turn. There is no incremental "add these envelopes" path yet.

## Caveats worth knowing

- **Every invocation is evidence, and the graph assumes it is good evidence.** Nothing in a trace says whether a turn went well, so nothing is filtered. This demo seeds from an agent that already performs well, which is the precondition the mode rests on.

  It matters more than the support ramp suggests. Edge weights inside a cluster set only their *order*, never their magnitude — so `gh_run_list x3` against `docker_build x1` is arm rank 0 against rank 1, a difference of `0.5/60` vs `0.5/61`. Measured on this catalog, adding a single wrong invocation of `docker_build` moves it from `0.016667` to `0.024863` and puts it back above `gh_run_list` at `0.024727`. A mistake that names the tool the base ranker already favours — the common case, since that is *why* the agent got it wrong — is close to free, and more good data does not dislodge it.
- **Turn text is not agent query text.** Members here are what a *user* wrote; after the flip, queries are what the *agent* writes when calling `search_capabilities`. The dense tier is what bridges that gap, so use `"semantic"` or `"hybrid"` for a real deployment — this demo runs on BM25 because near-repeat phrasings cluster without a model.
- **Tool ids must match.** An id recorded during capture that no longer exists in the serving catalog is dropped at rank time. The `usage_boost` trace event reports `dropped` so that shows up rather than looking like a coverage gap.
