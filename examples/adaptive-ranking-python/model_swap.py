"""Recovering adaptive ranking after an embedding-model swap.

    uv run model_swap.py

Unlike ``main.py`` (BM25, no model), this uses a **semantic** catalog, so it
needs the default embedding model (bge-small) available locally; it prints a
skip notice and exits cleanly if the model can't be loaded.

Centroids are tied to the model that built them, so a persisted graph loaded
under a *different* model can't be cosine-compared — the boost **pauses** instead
of ranking across incompatible vector spaces. ``rebuild_intent_graph()`` re-embeds
the graph under the current model; ``rebuild_on_model_change=True`` does that
automatically on the next dense search. The TypeScript mirror is
``examples/adaptive-ranking-ts/src/model-swap.ts``.
