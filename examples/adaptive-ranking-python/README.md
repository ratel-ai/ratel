# `examples/adaptive-ranking-python` — Ratel adaptive usage ranking

The Python mirror of [`examples/adaptive-ranking-ts`](../adaptive-ranking-ts/README.md): a `ToolCatalog` learns from the tools an agent actually invokes and reranks similar future queries, then persists what it learned and reloads it in a fresh process. **No model or API key** — it is a pure-Ratel feature demo over BM25. See [adaptive usage ranking](../../docs/adr/0014-adaptive-usage-ranking.md) for the design.

The scenario is a case description-writing can't fix: BM25 ranks `docker_build` first for *"why is the build broken"* (the token *build*), but the tool people reach for is `gh_run_list`. After a few real invocations the graph closes that gap.

## Setup

```bash
uv run main.py
```

`uv run` resolves `ratel-ai` from this monorepo (see `[tool.uv.sources]` in `pyproject.toml`), building the native extension on first run. Expected output — the boosted tool climbs after learning and survives the reload:

```
query: "why is the build broken"
  before learning : docker_build > gh_run_list
  after learning  : gh_run_list > docker_build   (rev=4)
  after reload    : gh_run_list > docker_build   (rev=4)

rev 4 -> 5: changed, so persist.
```

(BM25 only returns tools whose text matches the query, so `vault_rotate` — trained on a different query — never appears for a build question; that is retrieval working, not a bug.)

Run the test with `uv run pytest`.

## Layout

```
tools.py         catalog + session — the confidently-wrong catalog, the search->invoke pairs, learn/top_ids helpers
main.py          entry — before/after learning, persist via to_json, reload via from_json, rev-gated save
test_adaptive.py model-free assertion that learning promotes the real tool and survives a reload
```

## How it works, in three calls

- `catalog.enable_adaptive_ranking(graph)` — attach a shared `IntentGraph`; the catalog now learns from every `search` followed by an `invoke`.
- `graph.to_json()` / `IntentGraph.from_json(...)` — the graph lives in memory, so this is how learning outlives the process. Persist the bytes wherever you keep state. **Sensitive:** they contain the raw text of past user queries (the cluster `members`) — treat a saved graph like your query/telemetry log (restrict permissions, keep it out of version control and images).
- `graph.rev` — a monotonic write counter. Persist only when it changed since your last save (**save-when-changed**), and compare it to a stored graph's `rev` before overwriting to catch a concurrent writer (**stale-base detection**). Single-writer is the supported model.

Semantic and hybrid catalogs work the same way and cluster queries by *meaning* rather than shared words — attach the graph exactly as here; the only cost is the first-run embedding-model download.

## Recovering from an embedding-model swap

```bash
uv run model_swap.py
```

A graph's centroids are tied to the model that built them, so a persisted graph reloaded under a *different* embedding model can't be cosine-compared — the boost **pauses** (base ranking is untouched) rather than rank across incompatible vector spaces. `model_swap.py` shows the recovery both ways. Unlike `main.py` it uses a **semantic** catalog, so it needs the default model (bge-small) locally; it prints a skip notice and exits cleanly if the model can't load. Expected output:

```
after a model swap  : paused: model mismatch
after rebuild       : active
auto, before search : paused: model mismatch
auto, after search  : active
```

- `catalog.adaptive_ranking_status` — `"paused: model mismatch"` after the swap; gate on this instead of reading stderr.
- `await catalog.rebuild_intent_graph()` — re-embeds every cluster's members under the current model; support and edges survive, only centroids move. Raises `EmbedderError` if the model can't load.
- `enable_adaptive_ranking(graph, rebuild_on_model_change=True)` — opt in and the **next dense search** recovers for you. Recovery is lazy (`enable` is sync, the rebuild is async), so the status stays `paused` until that first search. Off by default because a rebuild is an embedding pass — cost, possible failure, and it mutates the graph.

## Why it's a separate package

Examples don't ship in `ratel-ai` — keeping them out of the published wheel keeps the public API surface narrow and dependency-free. This one pulls only `ratel-ai` itself, so it doubles as the smallest possible integration check.
