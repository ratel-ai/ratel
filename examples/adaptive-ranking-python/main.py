"""Adaptive usage ranking, end to end — no model or API key required.

    uv run main.py

BM25 alone ranks ``docker_build`` first for a build question; after learning
from real invocations ``gh_run_list`` climbs, and the learning survives a
save/reload through the graph's JSON wire form. ``rev`` is the primitive that
tells you when to persist. The TypeScript mirror is
``examples/adaptive-ranking-ts/src/index.ts``.
